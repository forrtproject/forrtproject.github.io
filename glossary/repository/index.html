Tenny and Abdelgawad (2017) defined it as “a measure of the probability of obtaining your data or more extreme data assuming the null hypothesis is true, compared to a pre-selected acceptable level of uncertainty regarding the true answer” (p. 1). Conventions for determining the threshold vary between applications and disciplines but ultimately depend on the considerations of the researcher about an appropriate error margin. The American Statistical Association’s statement (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016) notes that “Researchers often wish to turn a p-value into a statement about the truth of a null hypothesis, or about the probability that random chance produced the observed data. The p-value is neither. It is a statement about data in relation to a specified hypothetical explanation, and is not a statement about the explanation itself” (p. 131)."><a href=https://forrt.org/glossary/statistical-significance/ class=nav-link>Statistical significance</a></li><li class=nav-item data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right title="The extent to which conclusions from a statistical test are accurate and reflective of the true effect found in nature.

A systematic review will usually include a thorough, repeatable (reproducible) search strategy including key terms and databases in order to find relevant literature on a given topic or research question.

These papers can then be synthesised in a written review which may optionally include statistical synthesis in the form of a meta-analysis as well. A systematic review should follow a standard set of guidelines to ensure that bias is kept to a minimum for example PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021), Cochrane Systematic Reviews (Higgins et al., 2019), or NIRO-SR (Topor et al., 2021)."><a href=https://forrt.org/glossary/systematic-review/ class=nav-link>Systematic Review</a></li><li class=nav-item data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right title="tenzing is an online webapp and R package that helps researchers to track and report the contributions of each team member using the CRediT taxonomy in an efficient way.
