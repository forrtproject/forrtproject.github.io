  abstract: "Replication is widely recognized as essential for scientific self-correction, yet published replications remain exceedingly rare in both economics and psychology. At the same time, large-scale collaborative replication efforts and growing attention to research transparency have revealed widespread reproducibility failures across empirical research. This article reviews evidence on the scarcity of published replications, examines why traditional journals continue to resist publishing them, and evaluates the “first-best” proposal that journals should publish replications of their own articles. It then surveys alternative models that journals have adopted, such as dedicated replication sections and special replication issues, and considers their limitations in overcoming structural barriers to replication. Because these approaches have not meaningfully expanded the publication of replications, the article argues that dedicated replication journals offer an essential and complementary solution. By providing a stable, credible, and visible home for replication work, these journals supply critical infrastructure for the self-correcting function of science."

  abstract: "Reproducibility and replicability are vital for trustworthy, cumulative research, yet remain undervalued in most areas of academic publishing. Replication Research (R2) is a Diamond Open Access journal dedicated to publishing high-quality reproductions, replications, and related methodological work across disciplines. With robust standards for transparency, open peer review, and social responsibility, R2 offers practical guidance and support for authors. We aim to rebalance research culture by valuing diligence and robustness alongside innovation, thereby increasing confidence in research findings. We invite researchers to contribute to and benefit from an open, community-driven journal designed to elevate the status and impact of replications (repeated studies of published findings with different data) and reproductions (repeated tests of published findings with the same data). In this editorial, we introduce the aims, policies, and scope of Replication Research, outlining how the journal will operate and the values that guide it."

  abstract: "Not all people conform to socially constructed norms, nor should they have to. Neurodiversity, the natural variation in human brains and cognition, is fundamental to understanding human behavior, yet neurodivergent individuals in academia are often stigmatized, undervalued, or pressured to mask their differences. This position statement, authored predominantly by neurodivergent scholars, explores how aligning the values of the neurodiversity movement with practices of Open Scholarship (OSch) can foster greater research integrity, rigor, social responsibility and justice, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and accessibility in academia. We review systemic barriers faced by neurodivergent researchers—from disclosure dilemmas and hidden curriculum expectations to intersectional disadvantages—and identify how OSch principles (transparency, accessibility, collaboration) can help mitigate these challenges. Drawing on lived experiences and current research, we propose concrete reforms, including adopting universal design in scholarly communication, promoting participatory research methods, and enacting supportive policies (e.g., flexible work arrangements, inclusive codes of conduct). By leveraging shared values of openness and neuro-inclusion, academia can become more just and epistemically equitable. Our recommendations chart a path toward an academic culture where neurodivergent scholars can thrive openly, to the benefit of scientific rigor and social justice alike."

  journal_name: "Royal Society Open Science"
  authors: "Pownall, M., Azevedo, F., König, L. M., Slack, H. R., Evans, T. R., Flack, Z., ... & FORRT."
  abstract: "In recent years, the scientific community has called for improvements in the credibility, robustness and reproducibility of research, characterized by increased interest and promotion of open and transparent research practices. While progress has been positive, there is a lack of consideration about how this approach can be embedded into undergraduate and postgraduate research training. Specifically, a critical overview of the literature which investigates how integrating open and reproducible science may influence student outcomes is needed. In this paper, we provide the first critical review of literature surrounding the integration of open and reproducible scholarship into teaching and learning and its associated outcomes in students. Our review highlighted how embedding open and reproducible scholarship appears to be associated with (i) students' scientific literacies (i.e. students’ understanding of open research, consumption of science and the development of transferable skills); (ii) student engagement (i.e. motivation and engagement with learning, collaboration and engagement in open research) and (iii) students' attitudes towards science (i.e. trust in science and confidence in research findings). However, our review also identified a need for more robust and rigorous methods within pedagogical research, including more interventional and experimental evaluations of teaching practice. We discuss implications for teaching and learning scholarship."

  authors: "Hartmann H, Azevedo F, Röseler L, Wallrich L, Aldoh A, Elsherif MM, et al."
  abstract: "Replicability is a cornerstone of scientific progress. Yet, replications are often undervalued, and are sometimes seen as redundant, unimportant, or lacking novelty. This impedes their broader adoption in research and beyond. In response, the credibility revolution calls for slower, more deliberate science and greater responsiveness to fallibility. In this perspective piece, we argue that (a) replications are essential for validating scientific claims, (b) replications need to be made more visible, recognized, and integrated into research and educational practices, and (c) we can change the way we view and judge replication results. We propose a framework where replication studies can be systematically tracked and normalized through the Replication Hub as part of the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) initiative, with the goal of enhancing the visibility, integration, and cumulative impact of replication research across disciplines."

  abstract: "This chapter explores the critical role of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in advancing open science and promoting educational equity. OERs are freely-available teaching and learning materials that can be reused and adapted, making them powerful tools for democratising access to knowledge. Drawing on principles from critical pedagogy, feminist, and decolonial scholarship, we position OERs not only as cost-saving tools but as instruments of epistemic justice and inclusion. This chapter outlines five foundational principles for OER development—accessibility, inclusivity, collaboration, sustainability, and social justice—and offers a step-by-step framework for creating, implementing, and sustaining high-quality OERs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate participatory and community-driven approaches to OER creation. We also examine common challenges such as structural inequality and linguistic barriers, providing actionable strategies for addressing each. By embedding values of openness, fairness, and co-creation, we show how OERs can help reshape curricula and cultivate more inclusive academic ecosystems."

We conducted a scoping review to identify large-scale replication projects that used metrics and methodological papers that proposed or discussed metrics."

  abstract: "Since the introduction of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles in 2016, discussions have evolved beyond the original focus on research data to include learning resources. In 2020, a set of simple rules to FAIRify learning resources was proposed, building on existing expertise within the training community. Disciplinary communities have played an important role in advancing FAIR principles for learning resources, although they have approached FAIRification activities in different ways. These communities range from volunteer-led to funded and independent organisations, however commonly include activities such as organising training and capacity building, and coordinated discussions on disciplinary-focused FAIR best practices and standards."
