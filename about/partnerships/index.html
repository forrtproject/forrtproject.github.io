Local journal clubs help build community for those interested in discussing diverse issues around open and reproducible research, improving research quality, research integrity, and more. Local members take ownership of how their journal club runs; whether they focus on reading and discussing papers (e.g.
<a href=https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/ target=_blank rel=noopener>using RTea&rsquo;s reading lists</a>), or holding workshops and tutorials, and even hosting guest speakers. Started in early 2018 at the University of Oxford, ReproducibiliTea has now spread to over 100 institutions in 25 different countries.

We do this by investigating the factors that contribute to robust research, promoting training activities, and disseminating best practice. UKRN also works collaboratively with various external stakeholders to ensure coordination of efforts across the sector. UKRN seeks to understand the factors that contribute to poor research reproducibility and replicability, and develop approaches to counter these, in order to improve the trustworthiness and quality of research. These issues affect all disciplines, so we aim for broad disciplinary representation.</p><br><hr><br><p><img src=logos/A2P.webp alt="Access 2 Perspectives logo" align=left> As a scholarly training and consulting organization,

<a href=https://www.projecttier.org target=_blank rel=noopener>Project TIER</a> promotes the integration of principles of transparency and reproducibility in the quantitative methods training of undergraduate and graduate students. Project TIER is guided by the vision that students should be taught to use reproducible methods whenever they work with statistical data. Reproducibility should be integrated into introductory courses in statistics or data analysis, reinforced at all levels of the quantitative methods curriculum, and ultimately adopted by students when they conduct research for theses, dissertations, or other independent projects. To pursue this vision, Project TIER&rsquo;s strategy is to focus on supporting instructors who wish to incorporate transparency and reproducibility in their teaching and research supervision. The primary activities include developing standards and curriculum for reproducible research, and then disseminating those resources to instructors via the TIER website, conferences and symposia, and faculty development workshops.</p><br><hr><br><p><img src=logos/RN_German.webp align=left alt="The German Reproducibility Network (GRN) logo">

It informs about the availability of replication material for them and categorizes them by keywords, methods used, sources, type and geographic origin of data used, and by software used. It lists replication studies and their types and results as well as corrections and retractions. More than 4,600 studies are already listed as well as over 700 replications. The database helps social scientists to see which results have already been tested independently and how replications are published. For instructors it helps to easily identify practical examples, e.g., that for which a method was used that they want to teach and for which data and code are available in a software they can use with their students.</p><br><hr><br><p><img src=logos/PAPORTRAIL.webp align=left alt="PaPOR TRaIL logo">

<a href=http://www.abrirpsy.org target=_blank rel=noopener>ABRIR</a> (Advancing Big-team Reproducible science through Increased Representation) was established as a response to the global need of increasing representation in how we conduct open and big-team science, and as a necessity to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in psychological science. It was ‘born’ during the PSACON2021, when five psychological researchers from different parts of the world (Asia, East Europe and Latin America) gathered and discussed the position of researchers from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). They concluded that researchers from LMIC face unique challenges when fulfilling participatory or leadership roles in big-team and open science networks.

The JRP supports an average of six research projects each year, providing a framework (e.g., summer school, meet-ups, and conferences), leadership, and scientific support. We adhere to the principles of Open Science and aim to build research competencies in line with these values in our students and scientific research. By offering support, training, and engagement opportunities to the community, we hope to make the hidden curriculum of academia more transparent and equip the next generation of scholars with both the how and why of Open Science.

<a href=https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>The LMU Open Science Center (OSC)</a> has the mission to promote and foster open research practices at LMU Munich. It is led by Prof. Dr. Felix Schönbrodt. As a central knowledge hub, the OSC provides support for researchers on various aspects of open science, including research data management, FAIR data sharing, licensing, data privacy, and reproducible workflows. The OSC offers a range of services to researchers as well as students and research support staff, such as training programs, workshops, public talks, and the development of core curricula on open research practices. Additionally, the center is involved in original research on meta-science and reproducibility, contributing to the broader scientific community.</p><br><hr><br><p><img src=logos/dra.webp align=left width=200px alt="Digital Research Academy logo">
<a href=https://digital-research.academy/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The Digital Research Academy</a> is a community-driven network of expert trainers dedicated to improving the quality of research. They offer tailored training experiences in open science, data literacy, and research software engineering, equipping researchers with both digital and collaborative skills. By fostering a culture of openness, DRA&rsquo;s mission is to bridge knowledge gaps, cultivate innovation, and drive positive change through continuous learning and re-adapting.</p><br><hr><h2 id=forrt-membership-in-the-unesco-global-open-science-partnership>FORRT membership in the UNESCO Global Open Science Partnership</h2><a href=logos/2025_04_09_FORRT_Flavio_Azevedo_.pdf target=_blank><img src=logos/UNESCO.webp alt="UNESCO Logo"></a><p>Read more

<a href=https://osf.io/jqxw6/ target=_blank rel=noopener>The BordeauxTea</a> is a journal club organized in monthly sessions in which students and young researchers discuss various topics related to Open Science around a warm cup of tea. It is based in Bordeaux (France), and part of the Neurocampus Graduate Program PhD training (Université de Bordeaux). Moreover, the BordeauxTea stems from the ReproducibiliTea initiative—a worldwide Open Science initiative spread to more than 138 institutions in 26 countries.</p><br><hr><p><strong>Replication Hub & Database</strong>

<a href=https://www.uni-muenster.de/MueCOS/en/forschung/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>The Münster Center for Open Science (MüCOS)</a> was established in 2024 to support researchers at the University of Münster in designing and conducting transparent and reliable research. It is the first center that was brought to life by the university management (in contrast to traditional grass-roots initiatives).
As part of its research activities, the MüCOS collaborating closely with FORRT to maintain and expand the Replication Database and the Replication Hub.</p><br><hr><br><h2 id=cooperation--collaborations><strong>Cooperation & Collaborations</strong></h2><br><p><img alt=V22 src=/img/Partnerships_v3.webp></p><br><p><strong><em>Meta-psychology special issue</em></strong></p><p>     We have partnered with the journal

<a href=https://psysciacc.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Psychological Science Accelerator</a> to work on a recurring special issue. The call will request teaching materials, including pedagogical considerations, for the Educational NEXUS. This also sets the stage for our vision of academia in which the creation and maintenance of teaching resources are more valued - changing the publication’s structure to include these excellent and open resources.</p><p><strong><em>Center for Open Science - OSKB & COSGN</em></strong></p><p>     We are partnering up with
<a href=https://cos.io/oskb target=_blank rel=noopener>OSKB</a> (
<a href=https://cos.io/oskb target=_blank rel=noopener>Open Science Knowledge Base</a>) to coordinate the alignment of our meta-data on educational materials so that we share our resources and community. To that end, FORRT will have a community in OSKB’s home (
