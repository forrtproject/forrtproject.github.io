summary: FORRT conducts hackathon at the 3rd Annual AIMOS Conference on its Replications and Reversals project.

abstract: A (medical) reversal is when an existing treatment is found to be ineffective and harmful. In recent years, scholarship in Psychology showed that only 40-65% of some classic results were replicated. And even in those that replicated, the average effect found was half the originally reported effect. Psychology is not alone, medicine, cancer biology, and economics all have their share of irreplicable results. It is based on this that FORRT started a new initiative ("Replications & Reversals in Social Sciences") that collate reversal effects in social sciences to encourage researchers and educators to incorporate replications of these effects into their students' project (e.g., third-year, thesis, course work) as a means to provide them with the opportunity to experience the research processes directly, assess their ability to perform and report scientific research, and to help evaluate the robustness of the original study, thereby also helping them become good consumers of research. Join us in this hackathon to join this project, help collate reversals, and, eventually, draft a manuscript about the pedagogical consequences and applications of this project.
