# Our Goals

This team is responsible for discussing how open scholarship can be used to support the neurodiversity movement and enhance connections between open scholarship and neurodiversity; and how neurodiversity and open scholarship can intersect to make higher education more inclusive and accessible.

Although originally written about autistic people, we believe that this quote summarizes our approach to all forms of neurodiversity:

> ‘Their strengths and deficits do not deny them humanity but, rather, shape their humanity’ ([Grinker, 2010, p.173](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1352.2010.01087.x)).

# What We're About

## For Everyone

{{< expand "Expand to read what we do and why" >}}

### What is neurodiversity?

- Neurodiversity refers to the different ways we all think, feel and behave.
- Most people think, feel and behave in ways that society expects. These people are known as neurotypicals.
- Other people think, feel, and behave in ways different than society expects. These people are neurodivergent. They may have been given or identify with a diagnosis linked to this difference. Common examples include autism, ADHD, or a mental health label. But not every neurodivergent person has one of these labels.
- Society generally tells us that neurodivergence is a problem which needs to be fixed. The neurodiversity movement argues that these differences are a normal part of being human, so we should accept, include and support neurodivergent people.

### Why are you talking about neurodiversity?

- There is a community of people who research or teach for a living. They are known as academics and they often work in universities. There is a special culture associated with academics and their students, known as academia. 
- Academics are expected to work very hard. How hard they work is measured by how many times they write or talk about their research. Academics sometimes compete with each other over who writes and talks the most, which makes them work even harder.
- Neurodivergent people in academia face a lot of extra challenges. For example, they might behave in ways that neurotypicals do not expect. This can mean that the neurotypicals do not listen to them when they talk about their research.
- We think that the neurodiversity movement can help to make academia better for everyone, by promoting acceptance, inclusion and support for anyone that needs it. - We are doing our best to advertise the benefits of the neurodiversity movement.

### How can I learn more?
We are developing a lot of resources about neurodiversity in academia. Right now, these are mostly aimed at academics, so they can be a bit complicated or written using technical terms. You are welcome to read them and share them regardless!

### What is Neurodiversity?

A lack of diversity, equity and inclusion is bad for scholarship. Systemic barriers (such as hiding articles behind paywalls or geographical restrictions on conferences) prevent potential researchers with less access to resources from taking part in the research process. This limits the breadth of scientific progress, as a small and relatively homogenous group dictates which research questions are asked. Issues of diversity, equity and inclusion also arise within research which focuses on human research. A homogenous sample can lead to results which do not generalize across social groups - or worse, interventions which actively harm certain groups. So far, the majority of diversity, equity and inclusion work in open scholarship has focused on gender, ethnic/racial, and geographical disparities. However, issues linked to disability remain relatively under-discussed. At Team Neurodiversity, we hope to broaden these conversations to include and support the neurodiversity movement.

Neurodiversity refers to non-pathological variation in the human brain regarding movement, sociability, learning, attention, mood, and other mental functions at a group level (Singer, 2017). The neurological majority are known as neurotypical, while individuals who differ from this majority are referred to as neurodivergent. These differences can be present from birth (e.g. developmental or learning differences), or acquired during one’s life (e.g. due to an accident or medical condition such as a stroke). Neurodivergent individuals may have a diagnostic or identity label attached to their difference (such as autistic, ADHD or a mental health label), but this is not always the case.

The neurodiversity movement advocates for acceptance and inclusion of neurodivergent individuals in a way which emphasizes their strengths and rights to autonomy and support. This is in opposition to the medical model, which treats neurodivergence as a defect or deficit which needs to be normalized, cured, and eliminated. For example, imagine an autistic person who does not like to be hugged. The medical model may consider this a product of deficits in social communication and sensory processing, whereas the neurodiversity perspective would emphasize the need to respect the individual’s preferences regarding being hugged.

### Neurodiversity in Academia

At present, human sciences such as Psychology and Biomedicine tend to adopt the medical model of neurodiversity. This means that a large amount of research centres around “deficits”, treats neurodivergent people as an inferior group to neurotypicals, or excludes them from samples altogether. The opinions of neurodivergent communities are rarely included in research about them, and we believe this needs to change.  We, Team Neurodiversity, do not argue that deficits-based research is pointless! This research  has formed the foundations for neurotypical individuals to understand the challenges that we neurodivergent adults encounter as a result of our neurological differences. Instead, we advocate for academics, clinicians, researchers and speech-language therapists to reframe their framework in interpreting and discussing our challenges and impairments. We require a framework that promotes humility, compassion, respect and genuine impartiality. This is only possible with a diversity of minds and the inclusion of specific neurodiverse groups.

In our experiences, neurodivergent researchers also face unique challenges which are rarely acknowledged or addressed. The culture of academia emphasizes productivity, with recruitment and promotion requirements emphasizing metrics such as number of publications and amount of grant money awarded. Hyper-productivity creates wellbeing challenges for many people in the sector, but especially for neurodivergent academics who may express their productivity in different ways, or face additional barriers to completing these outputs. This in turn can result in neurotypicals labelling neurodivergent academics as “lazy” or “under-achievers”. For example, academia relies heavily on oral communication modalities. Academics are expected to present their work using the spoken word. This creates barriers for individuals who use other communication modalities (e.g. augmented communication, sign language), whose oral communication or body language differ in some way (e.g. stammering, less eye contact), or who struggle to process auditory input (e.g. due to sensory difficulties; although the use of live captioning is increasing). Expanding the notion of “success” in academia to include a broad and more flexible range of work would support neurodivergent academics, but would also benefit a range of neurotypical academics.

### Neurodiversity and Open Scholarship
Open scholarship refers to the idea that knowledge of all kinds should be openly shared, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative, inclusive, and allow for all knowledge systems. This applies to how knowledge is accumulated (via “open science” practices, such as free sharing of materials and data) and how knowledge is shared (e.g. through teaching and science communication practices).

We believe that the neurodiversity and open scholarship movements share fundamental principles - both are rooted in social justice, and share firm commitments to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. Furthermore, we believe that these movements can complement and progress each other.

We think that the neurodiversity movement can improve open scholarship by:

- Highlighting the barriers and challenges which neurodivergent academics face, how neurodivergence intersects with other identities, and potential solutions which dismantle systemic issues to make academia more inclusive and accessible for all.
- Promoting diversity of moral reasoning, cognitive biases, information processing, social norms and depth/breadth of research interests among academics - all of which influence the rigour and diversity of scientific processes.

Likewise, open scholarship can benefit the neurodiversity movement by:

- Providing open and accessible learning resources, which particularly benefit people who do not “fit the system” or do not have the opportunity to access closed scholarship.
- Ensuring that research on neurodiversity topics is high quality - rigorous, reproducible, replicable, generalizable, and accumulative.
- Making research and resulting policy openly available to the people it affects.

Mutual benefits include:
- Bringing neurodivergent voices into conversations of diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice within academia, in a way which promotes strengths as well as addressing difficulties.
- Abolishing barriers to education, facilitating career progression, and providing more opportunities for anyone to enter academia.
- A move to emancipatory and participatory research methods, which centre on co-creation and include neurodivergent individuals in the whole research process (“nothing about us without us”, from conception to publication).

# Our Resources

Our work falls into several general areas. Here, you can find resources related to each.

## Awareness & Acceptance

### APS Observer (October 2022)

[Our piece in the Association for Psychological Science’s Observer magazine](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/gs-navigating-academia-as-neurodivergent-researchers) was commissioned as part of their Global Spotlight series. In it, we explain how supporting the messages of both open scholarship and neurodiversity will ensure that the goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion reach across populations and explicitly include neurodivergent people. This is a readable introduction to issues regarding neurodiversity in psychology.

### Social Media Outreach

We celebrate neurodivergence, but also acknowledge that being a neurodivergent academic comes with unique challenges. We have been sharing our experiences on social media as part of neurodivergence celebration dates, with the aim of promoting understanding and acceptance of all aspects of neurodivergence.

{{< spoiler text= "Learn more" >}} 

  So far, we have created content for:
  * **[ADHD Awareness Month 2022](https://twitter.com/FORRTproject/status/1582634849944633344)**. Our ADHDer members shared what ADHD means to them, advice for others, and what they like about their ADHD brain.
  * **[Neurodiversity Celebration Week 2023](https://twitter.com/FORRTproject/status/1636773447492681741)**. Our members shared their thoughts about what neurodiversity is and what we'd like to change.
  * **[Autism Acceptance Week 2023](https://twitter.com/FORRTproject/status/1641097721745383424)**. Our autistic members shared what being autistic means to them, what they like about their autistic brains, what others can do to be more supportive.

{{< /spoiler >}}

### Experience Survey (coming soon!)

We are currently developing a survey which will research the experiences of neurodivergent scholars in academia. We hope that this will generate valuable data for understanding neurodivergent academics’ lives and careers.

### ADHDers in Academia (coming soon!)

We are developing a qualitative research project investigating the potentially unique ways that ADHDers do research or contribute to science, and the institutional and sociocultural barriers to inclusion and career progression for ADHDer academics. We hope that this will provide in-depth information about the experiences of people whose voices are rarely heard.

### Open Scholarship & Autism Research (coming soon!)

We are writing a manuscript which aims to promote Open Scholarship to academics and clinicians who research autism. In this, we will address criticisms of autism research and provide concrete suggestions for improved practices.

<br />

## DEI&A Tools for Academia

### Neurodivergent Authors Database

Our database collects together the details of neurodivergent researchers, papers authored by neurodivergent scholars, and other resources about neurodiversity. We hope that this will enable educators to create a more diverse curriculum. 

**As agreed with authors who shared their data with us, this database had now been unpublished as we cannot maintain it anymore.**

_This work was in part supported by a Grant-In-Aid to Reduce Barriers to Improving Psychological Science, awarded by the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) to Team Neurodiversity._

### Academic Wheel of Privilege (coming soon!)

We are developing a new, equity-based framework tailored to systemic biases and barriers in academia. We hope that this will be a useful diversity, equity and inclusion tool for academics to make authorship decisions. [Watch our video to find out more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzEdTyA06cU).

## Emancipatory & Participatory Research

### Participatory Research Primer for Cognitive Psychologists

Our article in the BPS Cognitive Psychology Bulletin discusses how participatory research can benefit open scholarship and vice versa, leading to a more generalizable and accurate science of human behavior and cognition. [Read the preprint.](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/jq23s/)

### Participatory Approaches to Big Team Science (coming soon!)

We are currently writing a manuscript which aims to reconcile Big Team Science with participatory research approaches. Big Team Science projects rarely include participants in the development of research questions and methodology. We argue that participatory approaches can improve Big Team Science by ensuring that large-scale research projects listen to and serve the communities they are researching.

<br />

## Rethinking Education Practices

### Assessment in Academia (coming soon!)

We are currently working on a manuscript which aims to encourage educators to rethink discriminatory practices embedded in academia, and to embrace Universal Design for Learning.

### Open Scholarship & Autism Education (coming soon!)

We are writing a manuscript which aims to promote Open Scholarship to academics and clinicians who educate about autism. In this, we will address criticisms of autism education and provide concrete suggestions for improved practices.

<br />

## Teaching & Training Resources

### Teaching and Mentorship

Team Neurodiversity member Jenny Mai Phan presented a talk titled “Neurodiversity and Open Scholarship: Guiding principles and practices for research and Higher Education”. This was presented on 29th June 2022, at RIOT Science Club’s 2022 conference on Teaching and Mentoring Open Research.

We recommend this talk for educators and researchers who wish to integrate intersectionality into their work. The talk outlined why neurodiversity and intersectionality should be embedded into open research teaching and mentorship. Jenny also provides useful strategies for achieving this.
