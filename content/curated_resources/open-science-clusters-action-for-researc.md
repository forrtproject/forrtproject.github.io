    "abstract": "OSCARS brings together world-class European Research Infrastructures (RIs) in the ESFRI roadmap and beyond to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe. The thematically oriented RIs are part of the five Science Clusters (Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Photon and Neutron Science, Astronomy, Nuclear and Particle Physics), which have strived to enable Open Science by providing FAIR data management policies and practices, and by contributing to a model of federation for thematic services that support both disciplinary communities, multidisciplinary initiatives and the wider public with harmonised models for access to data, tools, workflows and training. Today, the Science Clusters are an integral part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative and, through OSCARS, they continue to contribute to its development and implementation process.",
