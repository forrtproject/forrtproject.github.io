    "abstract": "Data availability and reusability are critical to open research. The FAIR principles provide a minimal set of guiding principles for making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Open data are not necessarily FAIR, and FAIR data are not necessarily open. Since their publication in 20161 the FAIR principles have accelerated the open data movement by inspiring activities and infrastructure development. The principles are also being adapted for other research outputs, such as software. As funders increasingly demand FAIR practices and researchers work to implement the FAIR principles, additional actions should be taken for responsible data use and reuse.",
