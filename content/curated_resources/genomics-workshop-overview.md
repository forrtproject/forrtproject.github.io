    "abstract": "Workshop overview for the Data Carpentry genomics curriculum. Data Carpentry\u2019s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including: best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command-line utilities, use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform variant calling, and connecting to and using cloud computing. This workshop is designed to be taught over two full days of instruction. Please note that workshop materials for working with Genomics data in R are in \u201calpha\u201d development. These lessons are available for review and for informal teaching experiences, but are not yet part of The Carpentries\u2019 official lesson offerings. Interested in teaching these materials? We have an onboarding video and accompanying slides available to prepare Instructors to teach these lessons. After watching this video, please contact team@carpentries.org so that we can record your status as an onboarded Instructor. Instructors who have completed onboarding will be given priority status for teaching at centrally-organized Data Carpentry Genomics workshops.",
