    "abstract": "Psychologists engage in the scientific process with the intention of developing and testing theories that explain and understand human psychology and behaviour. This module introduces students to scientific process and practices, in order to ensure that psychological research is as rigorous, transparent and, ultimately, as reproducible as possible. We will also discuss problematic practices that have frequently occured in psychological research, and discuss the impact they have had on psychological knowledge, as well as learning how to avoid such problematic practices in the future.",
