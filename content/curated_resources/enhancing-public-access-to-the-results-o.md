    "abstract": "The National Academies hosted a hybrid public workshop in Fall 2023, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, to explore approaches that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies could consider as they develop or update policies to enhance public access to the results of HHS-funded research. Workshop participants discussed how policy changes would promote equity in publication opportunities for investigators, provide ways to improve accessibility to publications by diverse communities of users, and increase findability and transparency of research results.",
