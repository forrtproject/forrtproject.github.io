    "abstract": "The goal of this repository is to index and host short videos that can be used to supplement the teaching of introductory statistics concepts. The purpose of these videos is to show students examples of statistical concepts being used in real research, to build off of foundational understanding of the concept they were introduced to in class. Let's show students real people, doing real research, and using real baby statistics to solve science! If you are interested to contribute a video to this page, please read the wiki, which explains what is needed in more depth. If you are still interested to contribute at that point, please request access as a contributor for the specific component(s) you would like to contribute to. If you would like to contribute a video for a topic that is not listed as a component, please contact JK Flake.",
