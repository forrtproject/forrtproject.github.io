    "abstract": "This project uses conversation analysis to identify key social actions that support knowledge sharing in interdisciplinary science teams. By analyzing meetings within a neuroscience collaboration, the researchers identified six interactional roles, chairlike, clarifying, skeptical, connecting, practical, and expert-like, that help integrate diverse disciplinary perspectives. Since these roles can be learned, fostering awareness and practice of them can enhance team collaboration, promote interdisciplinarity, and accelerate scientific innovation.",
