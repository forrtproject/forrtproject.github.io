    "abstract": "Introduction\nThe practice of creating large databases has become increasingly common by combining research participants\u2019 data into larger repositories. Funders now require that data sharing be considered in newly funded research project, unless there are justifiable reasons not to do so. Access to genomic data brings along a host of ethical concerns as well as fairness and equity in the conduct of collaborative research between researchers from high- income and low-and middle-income countries.\n\nMaterials and methods\nThis systematic review protocol will be developed in line with PRISMA -guidelines which refers to Open Science Framework, registered in PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) record CRD42022297984 and published in a peer reviewed journal. Data sources will include PubMed, google scholar, EMBASE, Web of science and MEDLINE. Both published and grey literature will be searched. Subject matter experts including bioethicists, principal investigators of genomic research projects and research administrators will be contacted. After de-duplication, titles and abstracts will be screened for eligibility. Data extraction will be undertaken using a piloted form designed in EPPI-Reviewer software before conducting risk of bias assessments by a pair of reviewers, acting independently. Any discrepancies will be resolved by consensus. Analysis will be done using a structured narrative synthesis and where feasible metanalysis. This review will attempt to highlight the context of data sharing practices in the global North-South and South-South collaborative human genomic research in low- and middle-income countries. This review will enhance the body of evidence on ethical, legal and social implications of data sharing in international collaborative genomic research setting criteria for data sharing. The full report will be shared with relevant stakeholders including universities, civil society, funders, and departments of genomic research to ensure an adequate reach in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).",
