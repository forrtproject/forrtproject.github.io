    "abstract": "Open Science is a global transition to making scientific research practices more open \nand collaborative, for greater scientific and societal impact. The goal of the Netherlands \nNational Open Science Programme (NPOS) is to facilitate all national stakeholders that are \njointly taking responsibility for the Open Science Agenda in the Netherlands, in alignment \nwith international initiatives. From 2023 on, this facilitating role will be taken up by the \nnew National Initiative on Open Science led by Dutch Research Council NWO, due to the \nfact that the ministry of Education, Culture and Science will make 20 million euros per year \navailable for Open Science until 2032.  \n\nThis Ambition Document includes the guiding principles that underlie our shared \nendeavours for the years to come; the vision for Open Science in the year 2030, the \nstrategic goals we are working towards,  and cross-cutting requirements for all actions to \nbe taken up. An open consultation in which 78 institutions, networks, communities and \nindividuals gave their constructive feedback, was part of the process of defining our shared \nambitions in the Ambition Document.
