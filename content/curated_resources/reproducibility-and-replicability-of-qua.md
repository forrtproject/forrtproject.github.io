    "abstract": "The integrative review presented here examines how reproducibility and replicability are conceptualized and discussed in relation to qualitative research, and which factors and practices enable or undermine them. Both peer-reviewed and grey English-language literature that address reproducibility and/or Open Science in relation to qualitative research were eligible for inclusion. Initial searches were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, PubMed, APA PsychInfo, and JSTOR, and followed with snowball sampling from included literature. Studies were screened and both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted using the SyRF online platform, with 248 papers included. We found that conceptualizations that stem from quantitative standpoints are overwhelmingly framed as inappropriate practices and epistemic criteria for (most) qualitative research. When conceptualized in alternative ways that are adapted to the epistemic conditions, aims and practices of qualitative research, they can be both applicable and appropriate. Key barriers include the ontological and epistemological misalignment of reproducibility, replicability and Open Science and qualitative research, and ethical and practical concerns surrounding data sharing and reuse. Key enablers include practices that respond to ethical and practical concerns around data sharing and reuse (anonymization, ethical consent practices, context documentation, and ethical access management), adapting expectations and norms of openness, and established qualitative practices including documentation, reflexivity, and considering positionality. We conclude that reproducibility, replicability and Open Science practices must be adapted to the aims and epistemic conditions of qualitative research for them to be applicable and feasible, and that they will not always be both for all qualitative research.\n",
