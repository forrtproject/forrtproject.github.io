    "abstract": "In this session we'll do a deep dive into the history of open-source software, it's ethical issues in the modern, hyper-capitalised development landscape, and how we can survive, as humans in a world where the hobbyist computer clubs of the early microcomputing era founded practices that are being weaponised against the individual in the 2020s.\n\nA vital, rollercoaster session about something that effects the livelihood of every developer - and is about finding the humanity in the centre of our software.",
