    "abstract": "Urgent attention is needed to address generalizability problems in psychology. However, the current dominant paradigm centered on dichotomous results and rapid discoveries cannot provide the solution because of its theoretical inadequacies. We propose a paradigm shift toward a model-centric science, which provides the sophistication to understand the sources of generalizability and promote systematic exploration. In a model-centric paradigm, scientific activity involves iteratively building and refining theoretical, empirical, and statistical models that communicate with each other. This approach is transparent and efficient in addressing generalizability issues. We illustrate the nature of scientific activity in a model-centric system and its potential for advancing the field of psychology.",
