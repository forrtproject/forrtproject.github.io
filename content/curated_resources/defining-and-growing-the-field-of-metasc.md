    "abstract": "In this talk, Professor Fidler argues how the field of metascience contrasts with many scientific disciplines because it works in service to science with a goal to improve the process by which science is conducted. The importance of creating a defined community is that is allows for norms to develop and for proper credit to be given for this work, without which it will be marginalized or demeaned. \n---\nAre you a funder interested in supporting research on the scientific process?

Funders are encouraged to review and adopt the practices overviewed at cos.io/top-funders as part of the solution to issues discussed during the Funders Forum.",
