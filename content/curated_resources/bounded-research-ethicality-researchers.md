    "abstract": "Bounded ethicality refers to people\u2019s limited capacity to consistently behave in line with their ethical standards. Here, we present results from a pre-registered, large-scale (N\u2009=\u200911,050) survey of researchers in Sweden, suggesting that researchers too are boundedly ethical. Specifically, researchers on average rated themselves as better than other researchers in their field at following good research practice, and rated researchers in their own field as better than researchers in other fields at following good research practice. These effects were stable across all academic fields, but strongest among researchers in the medical sciences. Taken together, our findings illustrate inflated self-righteous beliefs among researchers and research disciplines when it comes to research ethics, which may contribute to academic polarization and moral blindspots regarding one\u2019s own and one\u2019s colleagues\u2019 use of questionable research practices.",
