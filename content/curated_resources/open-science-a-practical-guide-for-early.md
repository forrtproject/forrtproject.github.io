    "abstract": "The Dutch consortium of University Libraries and the National Library of the Netherlands (UKB), together with the Universities of The Netherlands (UNL), the Dutch national centre of expertise and repository for research data (DANS) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO), has published a practical guide on open science.\n\nOpen Science\nReliable science is not the sole work of superhuman geniuses, but a collaborative process. Researchers rely and build upon each other\u2019s work. Together, we build theories, collect evidence and assess the research of colleagues. However, we can only build upon others\u2019 work if we know exactly what our predecessors have done: What were their methods, relevant materials, data and outputs? Therefore, sound science ideally equals Open Science, in which all phases of the research cycle are as transparent and accessible as possible.\n\nAbout this guide\nBeginning researchers are an important link in the transition to Open Science, so this guide is aimed at PhD candidates, Research Master Students, and early-career researchers from all disciplines at Dutch universities and research institutes. It is designed to accompany researchers in every step of their research, from the phase of preparing your research project and discovering relevant resources (chapter 2) to the phase of data collection and analysis (chapter 3), writing and publishing articles, data, and other research output (chapter 4), and outreach and assessment (chapter 5). Every chapter provides you with the best tools and practices to implement immediately. \n\nIf the information in this guide feels overwhelming: Do not worry! Open Science is a journey, and you are not alone in this. There are always colleagues who are happy to help you out along the way. You can find fellow researchers or support staff at your local Open Science Community (see chapter 6) and at your University Library.  \n\nWe hope this guide will motivate you and help you to practise Open Science, by sharing all aspects of your research with as many people as possible.\n\nThe Future is Open!",
