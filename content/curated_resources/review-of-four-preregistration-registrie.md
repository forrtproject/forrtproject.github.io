    "abstract": "Preregistration involves researchers publicly registering key study elements before conducting a study to increase the transparency of research and limit the use and impact of questionable research practices. To support special education researchers\u2019 engagement with preregistrations, in this article we provide an overview of preregistration and systematically review four preregistration registries (Open Science Framework, Registry of Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies, AsPredicted, and ClinicalTrials). Each of the registry templates reviewed effectively addresses most questionable research practices and can accommodate a variety of research designs, with the exception of mixed-methods research. Among the benefits of Registry of Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies, Open Science Framework, and ClinicalTrials are the provision of highly specific templates and allowing users to update the preregistration when changes to the original study occur. Researchers can use this review to help select and use a registry that is appropriate for their study design and purpose.",
