    "abstract": "Files for this webinar are available at: https://osf.io/ewhvq/ This webinar focuses on how to use the Open Science Framework (OSF) to tie together and organize multiple projects. We look at example structures appropriate for organizing classroom projects, a line of research, or a whole lab's activity. We discuss the OSF's capabilities for using projects as templates, linking projects, and forking projects as well as some considerations for using each of those capabilities when designing a structure for your own project. The OSF is a free, open source web application built to help researchers manage their workflows. The OSF is part collaboration tool, part version control software, and part data archive. The OSF connects to popular tools researchers already use, like Dropbox, Box, Github and Mendeley, to streamline workflows and increase efficiency.",
