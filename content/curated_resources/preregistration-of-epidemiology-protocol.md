    "abstract": "It has been proposed that observational epidemiology protocols, just like those for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), should be preregistered. Unlike the editors of the Lancet and BMJ who have endorsed the proposal, the Epidemiology editors and 5 commentators all resisted. One does not have to agree with all the details of the workshop document to believe that protocol registration has substantial advantages in epidemiologic research. Some of them are reported in this article.",
