    "abstract": "We provide a neuroimaging database consisting of 102 synaesthetic brains using state-of-the-art 3\u2009T MRI protocols from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) which is freely available to researchers. This database consists of structural (T1- and T2-weighted) images together with approximately 24\u2009minutes of resting state data per participant. These protocols are designed to be inter-operable and reproducible so that others can add to the dataset or directly compare it against other normative or special samples. In addition, we provide a \u2018deep phenotype\u2019 of our sample which includes detailed information about each participant\u2019s synaesthesia together with associated clinical and cognitive measures. This behavioural dataset, which also includes data from (N\u2009=\u2009109) non-synaesthetes, is of importance in its own right and is openly available.",
