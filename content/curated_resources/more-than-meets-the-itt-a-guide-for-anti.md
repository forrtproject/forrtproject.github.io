    "abstract": "Survey experiments often yield intention-to-treat effects that are either statistically and/or practically \u201cnon-significant.\u201d There has been a commendable shift toward publishing such results, either to avoid the \u201cfile drawer problem\u201d and/or to encourage studies that conclude in favor of the null hypothesis. But how can researchers more confidently adjudicate between true, versus erroneous, nonsignificant results? Guidance on this critically important question has yet to be synthesized into a single, comprehensive text. The present essay therefore highlights seven \u201calternative explanations\u201d that can lead to (erroneous) nonsignificant findings. It details how researchers can more rigorously anticipate and investigate these alternative explanations in the design and analysis stages of their studies, and also offers recommendations for subsequent studies. Researchers are thus provided with a set of strategies for better designing their experiments, and more thoroughly investigating their survey-experimental data, before concluding that a given result is indicative of \u201cno significant effect.\u201d",
