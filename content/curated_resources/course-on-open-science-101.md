    "abstract": "These lectures and tutorials introduce students to the scientific process and open research practices, in order to ensure that psychological research is as rigorous, transparent and, ultimately, as reproducible as possible. We also consider problematic practices that have frequently occurred in psychological research, and discuss the impact they have had on psychological knowledge, as well as learning how to avoid such problematic practices in the future. The module content was designed to be delivered at a first-year undergraduate level, and can also be delivered in a pretty modular fashion, allowing the tutor to pick and choose which sessions best suit their programme or student needs.",
