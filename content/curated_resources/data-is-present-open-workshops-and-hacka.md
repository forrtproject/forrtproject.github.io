    "abstract": "Original data has become more accessible thanks to cultural and technological advances. On the internet, we can find innumerable data sets from sources such as scientific journals and repositories, local and national governments, and non-governmental organisations. Often, these data may be presented in novel ways, by creating new tables or plots, or by integrating additional data. Free, open-source software has become a great companion for open data. This open scholarship project offers free workshops and coding meet-ups (hackathons) to learn and practise data presentation, across the UK. It is made possible by a fellowship of the Software Sustainability Institute.",
