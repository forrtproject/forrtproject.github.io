We will wrestle with the fundamental issues for designing and executing a program of research, and in the interpretation and reporting of research results. The class is organized around the development and execution of a single, actual research project from conception through completion. Class hours are devoted to conceptual issues in research design, execution and interpretation. Lab hours are devoted to presentation and critique of research plans.",
