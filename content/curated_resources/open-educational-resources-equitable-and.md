    "abstract": "This research report describes findings from a study conducted to learn students\u2019 experiences using open educational resources (OER) in an online nursing research course. Twenty-three students participated in a pilot study in which traditional textbooks were replaced with OER as the primary course material. Data were collected by administering open-ended and closed-ended questions about students\u2019 experiences and demographic characteristics. Findings indicated that OER were cost-effective, accessible, easy to navigate, and interesting. The resources were adequate to meet student learning outcomes. Challenges experienced were related to poor Internet access for a few students.",
