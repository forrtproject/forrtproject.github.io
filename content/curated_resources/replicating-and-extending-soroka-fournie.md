    "abstract": "This student-led replication study tested the negativity bias hypothesis\u2014the idea that people react more strongly to negative than positive news\u2014using a preregistered, well-powered design in the Netherlands. It replicated key findings from Soroka et al. (2019), showing that negative news increases physiological arousal. The study extended the original by also demonstrating muscle activation linked to negative affect, showing that positive news can elicit more self-reported arousal, and validating the theory in a new national context. It highlights both the scientific and educational impact of high-quality replication work.",
