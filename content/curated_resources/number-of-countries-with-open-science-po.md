    "abstract": "Eleven countries have introduced open science policies, strategies and legislative frameworks since the adoption of the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science two years ago, according to the UNESCO Open Science Outlook 1: Status and Trends Around the World. This means that the the total number of countries with open science policies has almost doubled. Other countries have adopted policies that pertain to one aspect of open science, such as for publications and/ or research data. The Outlook was launched on 14 December in Geneva at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) as a prelude to the closing ceremony of the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development.",
