The course will include several practical workshops on how to use organizational tools (Open Science Framework, RStudio projects, version control systems (Git, GitHub), collaborative platforms (OSF)) to establish a reproducible and transparent workflow, as well as workshops on how to plan and preregister a study (including its sampling design and statistics) to obtain reliable and credible scientific results\n",
