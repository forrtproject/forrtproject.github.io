    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study examines discrepancies between registered protocols and subsequent publications for drug and diet trials whose findings were published in prominent clinical journals in the last decade. ClinicalTrials.gov was established in 2000 in response to the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, which called for registration of trials of investigational new drugs for serious diseases. Subsequently, the scope of ClinicalTrials.gov expanded to all interventional studies, including diet trials. Presently, prospective trial registration is required by the National Institutes of Health for grant funding and many clinical journals for publication.1 Registration may reduce risk of bias from selective reporting and post hoc changes in design and analysis.1,2 Although a study3 of trials with ethics approval in Finland in 2007 identified numerous discrepancies between registered protocols and subsequent publications, the consistency of diet trial registration and reporting has not been well explored.",
