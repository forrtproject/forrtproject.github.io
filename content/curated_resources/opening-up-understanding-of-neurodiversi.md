    "abstract": "Recent movements towards a more open, intersectional, and inclusive academia (Birhane & \nGuest,  2020)  focus  on  the  need  to  address  traditional  power  imbalances  detrimentally \naffecting under-represented individuals (e.g.,  women: Pownall  &  Rogers,  2021;  people  of \ncolour:  Berhe  et  al.,  2022;  non-WEIRD  [Western,  Educated,  Industrialised,  Rich,  and \nDemocratic] societies: Puithllam  et al., 2022). Hitherto, neurodivergent  perspectives  \u2014i.e. \nnon-pathological  variations  in  human  brains  (Walker,  2021)\u2014  are  often  overlooked  and \nmisunderstood  within  behavioural  and  cognitive  sciences.  It  is  common  to  encounter \nassumptions that anything outside of neurotypicality is at best dismissed as outlier data, or at worst, considered disadvantageous and in need of \u2018fixing\u2019 (e.g., Gernsbacher & Pripas-Kapit, 2012). Such viewpoints hinder a broader understanding of human behaviour and cognition. Here,  we    call  for  more  open  and  Participatory  Research  on  neurodiversity  through addressing the issue of power imbalance.  ",
