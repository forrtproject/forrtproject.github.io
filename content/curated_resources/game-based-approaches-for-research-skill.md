    "abstract": "Research skills training is both crucial and ubiquitous in Higher Education (HE), however there are a range of pedagogical challenges in effectively delivering research capabilities and learning outcomes. The move towards constructivism, including game-based learning (GBL) techniques, in research skills training has been shown to improve outcomes for students, yet GBL for research skills is under-researched compared to other application domains.\n\nThis paper analyses the results of a new survey of attitudes towards GBL specifically for improving research skills training in UK HE institutions. Responses came from 92 researcher developers, research leaders, librarians, and academic skills teachers. Results demonstrate a very strong appetite for games and gamified approaches in this topic area, with a large majority of respondents noting the potential for novel, interactive and experiential techniques for delivering high-level learning outcomes. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses identifies and analyses key themes such as: institutional and attitudinal barriers to the use of GBL; the need for balancing flexibility in learning approaches with a structured framework to scaffold learning; and for a choice of complementary methods to suit diverse learner cohorts. Other key findings are related to accessibility; platforms for engagement; cultural knowledge and perceptions; and the potential for cognitive overload. Results also identify those topics within researcher development that are thought to be most important for GBL approaches.\n\nThis paper gives a clear overview of the attitudes, opportunities, barriers, and concerns of HE staff when considering the use of GBL to complement existing research skills training provision in universities and contextualizes this with current opportunities for engagement with GBL for research skills.",
