    "abstract": "To help ease the process with content development, we provide here a course outline in the form of a syllabus (i.e. module description) for a general open science course that overviews the most pertinent topics important to early career researchers from upper class bachelor students up through postdoctoral scientists. This course can also be applicable to other scientific professionals (e.g. software engineers, lab technicians, etc.).\n\nThis outline is meant to be delivered over a period of 12 weeks with two 90 minute lectures per week for a class size of around 20 students.\n\nThe syllabus uses open education resources found on the internet from a variety of sources. In the process of creating this syllabus, we collected a list of OERs, which can be found at the end of the syllabus.\n\nThe syllabus also includes a variety of suggested assignments to choose from to tailor the course to the needs of the students and institutional requirements.\n\nThe contents of the syllabus are released under the CC BY 4.0 license, which means that anyone can copy, distribute, and make derivatives of the content as long as the original authors are credited.",
