    "abstract": "The OSF Collections repository platform supports the discoverability and reuse of research by enabling the aggregation of related projects across OSF. With OSF Collections, any funder, journal, society, or research community can show their commitment to scientific integrity by aggregating the open outputs from their disciplines, grantees, journal articles, or more. Learn how research collections can foster new norms for sharing, collaboration, and reproducibility.\n\nWe also provide a demo of how OSF Collections aggregates and hosts your research by discipline, funded outcomes, project type, journal issue, and more.\n\nVisit cos.io/collections to learn more.",
