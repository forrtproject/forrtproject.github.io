    "abstract": "I believe that higher education should be focused on developing passionate, critical, independent and creative thought, and the transmission of knowledge should be in the service of developing these skills. In the classroom, I try to communicate the core issues and controversies within an area in an interactive fashion, drawing students into the material though exercises and debate. This experience provides a deeper understanding of the material and encourages students to think critically about how scientific conclusions depend on the research process. In addition, I try to teach case studies of scientific controversy on topical issues to illustrate that science is not simply an assembly of facts but a method for developing and testing ideas. In my experience, this approach has led naturally to classroom discussions where students share their own insights and critical perspectives.",
