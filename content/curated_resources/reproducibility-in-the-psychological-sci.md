    "abstract": "Science is undergoing a paradigm shift in the way research is conducted and what is considered evidence. Psychology is leading other disciplines in innovative methods to address concerns related to replication and transparency by creating meta-science projects (i.e., Reproducibility Project, Many Labs) and other tools (Transparency of Publication Guidelines, Open Data Badges) to maximize reproducibility in psychology and other sciences. In addition to reading primary articles reporting findings emerging from these efforts, students will engage in the projects through critical evaluation of research protocols, reanalysis of data, and writing APA research reports of findings.",
