    "abstract": "The replication crisis threatens to seriously impact theory development in the cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences. We\ncanvas three desiderata of scientific theories (explanation, prediction, and unification) and argue that the extent to which\nfailures of replication prove problematic depends on the primary purpose of a theory. If the aim is to explain how nature\nworks, then accuracy\u2014and thus replicability\u2014of the findings on which the theory is built is essential. If the aim is to predict\noutcomes, then replicability of findings from which the predictive model or theory is built is only important as far as it affects\nthe reliability and accuracy of the predictions. If the aim is to unify and organize disparate findings, then the replicability of\nfindings plays a non-essential role. The result is that a multifaceted and nuanced perspective is required to assess the value of\nreplicability and the need for replication studies. Specifying a theory\u2019s purpose and background commitments should clarify\nthe debate on replication and contribute to better theory development in the cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences.",
