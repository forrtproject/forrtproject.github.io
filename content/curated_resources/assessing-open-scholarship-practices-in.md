    "abstract": "Open scholarship practices, which involve sharing data, materials, preregistering studies, replication, sharing preprints, and reporting null results, have gained significant attention in the academic community. The Open Scholarship Survey (OSS) has completed two waves of data collection between Fall 2020 and Summer 2022 to gauge attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of education researchers regarding these practices. Here, we summarize findings for education researchers, but please see the full report for additional details.",
