    "abstract": "The United Kingdom is experiencing the largest-ever increase in public investment in \nresearch and development, with the Government R&D budget set to reach \u00a320 billion \na year by 2024/5. The creation of the new Department for Science, Innovation and \nTechnology has been advanced by the Government as heralding an increased focus on \nresearch and innovation\u2014seen to be among Britain\u2019s main strengths. At the same time, there have been increasing concerns raised that the integrity of some scientific research is questionable because of failures to be able to reproduce the claimed findings of some experiments or analyses of data and therefore confirm that the original researcher\u2019s conclusions were justified. Some people have described this as a \u2018reproducibility crisis\u2019.\nIn 2018, our predecessor committee published a report \u2018Research Integrity\u2019. Some of \nthe recommendations of that report were implemented\u2014such as the establishment of a \nnational research integrity committee. This report looks in particular at the issue of the reproducibility of research.",
