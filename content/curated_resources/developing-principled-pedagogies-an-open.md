    "abstract": "Gilad Feldman is Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). His research focuses on judgement and decision making and he strongly supports the Open Science movement at all levels - from his teaching philosophy, to the development of open teaching materials and resources, and the involvement of students in Open Science training and practice. One of Gilad\u2019s most known projects is the student-led pre-registered replications and extensions, which you can find here: https://mgto.org/core-team/. But be sure to check all his other amazing meta science resources such as his course syllabi and the \u201cCheck me, Replicate me\u201d initiative (all links can be found below).\n\nFORRT\u2019s Team Pedagogies took the opportunity to ask Gilad some questions on his journey through and with Open Science (shoutout to the FORRT and academic Twitter community for sending so many great questions). You can watch or listen to the interview in the video or read a summary of his main points below! We hope you enjoy and learn as much as we did!",
