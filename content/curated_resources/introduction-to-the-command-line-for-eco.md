    "abstract": "Command line interface (OS shell) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer\u2019s operating system. The shell is a program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination. There are quite a few reasons to start learning about the shell: The shell gives you power. The command line gives you the power to do your work more efficiently and more quickly.
