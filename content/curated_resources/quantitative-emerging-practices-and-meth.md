    "abstract": "Recently, a reporter in the Chronicle of Higher Education wrote that \u201cpsychology is having an uneasy moment\u201d (Zamudio-Suarez, 2016). The \u201cuneasy moment\u201d to which she referred is a movementof field self-criticism that has gained incredible steam and features media coverage, twitter wars, and a numerous methods-focused blogs.The purpose of this course is to sort through the criticisms and recommendations that have emerged in our field. We will address a wide swath of topics including historical and emerging concerns about our practices, modern journal requirements, and recommendations on the horizon. The course will center primarily around three types of topics: 1) philosophy of psychological science, 2) criticisms of past and present practices, 3) practical (andimpractical) solutions.The course will be driven by both discussion and hands-on practice. On most days, we will spend the first half of class discussing readings and the second half of class learning hands-on practices.",
