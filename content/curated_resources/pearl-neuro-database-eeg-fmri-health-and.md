    "abstract": "Interdisciplinary approaches are needed to understand the relationship between genetic factors and brain structure and function. Here we describe a database that includes genetic data on apolipoprotein E (APOE) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) genes, both of which are known to increase the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, paired with psychometric (memory, intelligence, mood, personality, stress coping strategies), basic demographic and health data on a cohort of 192 healthy middle-aged (50\u201363) individuals. Part of the database (~79 participants) also includes blood tests (blood counts, lipid profile, HSV virus) and functional neuroimaging data (EEG/fMRI) recorded with a resting-state protocol (eyes open and eyes closed) and two cognitive tasks (multi-source interference task, MSIT; and Sternberg's memory task). The data were validated and showed overall good quality. This open-science dataset is well suited not only for research relating to susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease but also for more general questions on brain aging or can be used as part of meta-analytical multi-disciplinary projects.",
