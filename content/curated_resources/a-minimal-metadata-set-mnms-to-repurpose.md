    "abstract": "Although biomedical research is experiencing a data explosion, the accumulation of vast quantities of data alone does not guarantee a primary objective for science: building upon existing knowledge. Data collected that lack appropriate metadata cannot be fully interrogated or integrated into new research projects, leading to wasted resources and missed opportunities for data repurposing. This issue is particularly acute for research using animals, where concerns regarding data reproducibility and ensuring animal welfare are paramount. Here, to address this problem, we propose a minimal metadata set (MNMS) designed to enable the repurposing of in vivo data. MNMS aligns with an existing validated guideline for reporting in vivo data (ARRIVE 2.0) and contributes to making in vivo data FAIR-compliant. Scenarios where MNMS should be implemented in diverse research environments are presented, highlighting opportunities and challenges for data repurposing at different scales. We conclude with a \u2018call for action\u2019 to key stakeholders in biomedical research to adopt and apply MNMS to accelerate both the advancement of knowledge and the betterment of animal welfare.",
