    "abstract": "We present the design of a portable coronagraph, CATEcor (where CATE stands for Continental-America Telescope Eclipse), that incorporates a novel \u201cshaded-truss\u201d style of external occultation and serves as a proof-of-concept for that family of coronagraphs. The shaded-truss design style has the potential for broad application in various scientific settings. We conceived CATEcor itself as a simple instrument to observe the corona during the darker skies available during a partial solar eclipse, or for students or interested amateurs to detect the corona under ideal noneclipsed conditions. CATEcor is therefore optimized for simplicity and accessibility to the public. It is implemented using an existing dioptric telescope and an adapter rig that mounts in front of the objective lens, restricting the telescope aperture and providing external occultation. The adapter rig, including occulter, is fabricated using fusion deposition modeling (FDM; colloquially \u201c3D printing\u201d), greatly reducing cost. The structure is designed to be integrated with moderate care and may be replicated in a university or amateur setting. While CATEcor is a simple demonstration unit, the design concept, process, and trades are useful for other more sophisticated coronagraphs in the same general family, which might operate under normal daytime skies outside the annular-eclipse conditions used for CATEcor.",
