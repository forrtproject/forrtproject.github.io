They cover topics such as pre-prints, open licenses, questionable publication practices (forthcoming) and how to apply open science in practice.\n\nAll guides are open access and are available via the open repository Zenodo. For ease of reference, we have gathered the guides below. The list will be updated as more guides are published in the future. ",
