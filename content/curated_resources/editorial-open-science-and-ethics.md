    "abstract": "Academic institutions in Europe (e.g. universities, research funding institutions, academies) are\nincreasingly committing themselves to \u2018open science\u2019 principles (see e.g. http://openscienceasap.\norg/open-science/). Those principles are increasingly seen as the basis of good academic practice.\nThey include a broad spectrum of considerations. On a primary level they include principles like\n\u2018transparent documentation of methodology\u2019 and \u2018peer review\u2019 that are already well-established\nelements of academic practices. On a secondary level they have to do with access to research (use\nof open sources and open access): access not only to the results of research, but also to underlying\ninformation, such as the empirical data on which research results are based. On a further level\nopen science refers to a research culture in which research is communicated in ways that are not\nonly accessible to specialists in a field. Open science principles require that such communication\nwith various societal stakeholders should not only be a one-way communication (academics\ninform the public about their research results) but instead should be a two-way communication, in\nwhich relevant stakeholders should have significant impact on the formulation of research\nquestions. Research processes should in this view be increasingly seen as responsive to public\ndiscussions and public interests. The role of research can be summarized as supporting society in\nunderstanding and solving societal challenges.",
