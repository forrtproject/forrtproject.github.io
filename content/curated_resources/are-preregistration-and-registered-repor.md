    "abstract": "Preregistration of study hypotheses has been proclaimed as the \u201crevolution\u201d1 to curb publication bias and data dredging such as p-hacking and HARKing, i.e., hypothesizing after results are known. Many publishers encourage preregistration in their submission policies,2 and a similar trend is being seen in registered reports, which are preregistration of a study plan, prereview, and acceptance for publication, all before data/results are seen.3 Sharp growth of platforms to facilitate preregistration, e.g., the Open Science Framework, has ensued.\n\nA recent analysis on preregistered studies showed an increase in reports of null findings,4 which should be a reassurance against the specter of p-hacking. However, new evidence indicates that preregistration is being circumvented,5 with authors often deviating from registered plans and not fully disclosing it.",
