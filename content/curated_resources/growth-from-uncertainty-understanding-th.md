    "abstract": "Psychology is a discipline that has a high number of failed replications, which has been characterised as a \u2018crisis\u2019 on the assumption that failed replications are indicative of\nuntrustworthy research. This paper uses Chang\u2019s concept of epistemic iteration to show how a research programme can advance epistemic goals despite many failed replications.\nIt illustrates this through analysing an on-going large-scale replication attempt of Southgate\u2019s 2007 work exploring infants\u2019 understanding of false beliefs. It concludes that\nepistemic iteration offers a way of understanding the value of replications \u2014 both failed and successful \u2014 that contradicts the narrative centred around distrust.",
