    "abstract": "Health data are extremely important in today\u2019s data-driven world. Through automation, healthcare processes can be optimized, and clinical decisions can be supported. For any reuse of data, the quality, validity, and trustworthiness of data are essential, and it is the only way to guarantee that data can be reused sensibly. Specific requirements for the description and coding of reusable data are defined in the FAIR guiding principles for data stewardship. Various national research associations and infrastructure projects in the German healthcare sector have already clearly positioned themselves on the FAIR principles: both the infrastructures of the Medical Informatics Initiative and the University Medicine Network operate explicitly on the basis of the FAIR principles, as do the National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data and the German Center for Diabetes Research.\n\nTo ensure that a resource complies with the FAIR principles, the degree of FAIRness should first be determined (so-called FAIR assessment), followed by the prioritization for improvement steps (so-called FAIRification). Since 2016, a set of tools and guidelines have been developed for both steps, based on the different, domain-specific interpretations of the FAIR principles.\n\nNeighboring European countries have also invested in the development of a national framework for semantic interoperability in the context of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Concepts for comprehensive data enrichment were developed to simplify data analysis, for example, in the European Health Data Space or via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. With the support of the European Open Science Cloud, among others, structured FAIRification measures have already been taken for German health datasets.",
