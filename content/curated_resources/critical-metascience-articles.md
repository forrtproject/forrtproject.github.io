    "abstract": "Metascience is the science of science. Critical metascience takes a step back to question some common assumptions, approaches, problems, and solutions in metascience. Hence, it has also been described as meta-meta-science!\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive collection of over 200 articles in this area. These articles address issues such as (a) metascience's focus on replication, statistics, and methods-based reforms; (b) the credibility and rigour of metascientific research; (c) inclusivity and diversity in open science; (d) the rationale for and implemention of preregistration and open data; (e) the importance of theory and theory development; and (f) the sociology of the science reform movement. These and other issues are considered from a variety of different perspectives including, for example, work by statisticians, psychologists, cognitive scientists, social scientists, ethnographers, sociologists, philosophers of science and, of course, metascientists!\n\nBelow, I've grouped articles by year and then, further down the page, by topic. If I've left out a key article, or there's new work you'd like added, please send me the reference.\n\nI'm grateful to Daniele Fanelli for his suggestions of multiple additions to this collection.",
