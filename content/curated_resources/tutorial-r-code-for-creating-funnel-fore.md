    "abstract": "Meta-analyses are often accompanied by two popular forms of data visualization: forest plots and funnel plots. In this post, I\u2019ll show how quick-and-dirty forest and funnel plots can be created with the metafor package. After, I\u2019ll show how we can instead use the ggplot2 package to create forest plots and use the ggplot2 package to create funnel plots, so that we can have pretty plots that are easy to change/stylize, and that can be produced regardless of which meta-analysis package for R that you elect to use.",
