    "abstract": "To provide educators with an example of how they can draw resources from FORRT\u2019s educational nexus to integrate open scholarship into their teaching, FORRT has developed an Open and Reproducible Science 101 syllabus.\n\nFORRT\u2019s syllabus was developed as a seminar series covering 9 weeks of teaching. In an attempt to be comprehensive of the open scholarship literature, the syllabus builds on FORRT\u2019s cluster framework. As such, the proposed topic for each week is one of FORRT\u2019s clusters and its related literature. For each week, there are suggestions of core and additional readings. The syllabus is comprised of a series of assignments and proposed activities for students.\n\nImportantly, this syllabus is not intended to be a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach. While educators are welcomed to use this syllabus in its current format, they can also adapt it to meet their current courses and needs. We hope it can serve as starting point for your class.\n\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfFro5MbwBHzzXTeM_lE1gjFuq7AnnKWSDWkVwOBAtE/edit#",
