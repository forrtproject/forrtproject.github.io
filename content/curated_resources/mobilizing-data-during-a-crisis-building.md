    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic generated tremendous interest in using real world data (RWD). Many consortia across the public and private sectors formed in 2020 with the goal of rapidly producing high-quality evidence from RWD to guide medical decision-making, public health priorities, and more. Experiences were gathered from five large consortia on rapid multi-institutional evidence generation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Insights have been compiled across five dimensions: consortium composition, governance structure and alignment of priorities, data sharing, data analysis, and evidence dissemination. The purpose of this piece is to offer guidance on building large-scale multi-institutional RWD analysis pipelines for future public health issues.\nThe composition of each consortium was largely influenced by existing collaborations. A central set of priorities for evidence generation guided each consortium, however different approaches to governance emerged. Challenges surrounding limited access to clinical data due to various contributors were overcome in unique ways. While all consortia used different methods to construct and analyze patient cohorts ranging from centralized to federated approaches, all proved effective for generating meaningful real-world evidence. Actionable recommendations for clinical practice and public health agencies were made from translating insights from consortium analyses.\nEach consortium was successful in rapidly answering questions about COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment despite all taking slightly different approaches to data sharing and analysis. Leveraging RWD, leveraged in a manner that applies scientific rigor and transparency, can complement higher-level evidence and serve as an important adjunct to clinical trials to quickly guide policy and critical care, especially for a pandemic response.",
