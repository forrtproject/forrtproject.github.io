    "abstract": "LCIRT was established in 2001 to pioneer LD research, discover innovative strategies and practices, and improve teaching and learning outcomes for students with learning disabilities (like dyslexia), ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and educators in high school and college settings. Currently, the Institute staff shares this information with education professionals through webinars, online certificate courses, on-site and online workshops, and the signature Summer Institute for educators, among other activities. Fully integrated within the College, LCIRT is instrumental in promoting and leveraging the knowledge and expertise of Landmark College's faculty and staff. The Neurocognitive Lab, which includes vitual reality (VR) equipment, makes LCIRT a popular environment for student research.",
