    "abstract": "Joy in Academia is a podcast series that highlights how racialized academics in the Netherlands and Belgium cultivate joy within academic institutions often shaped by exclusion. Through conversations across fields like law, psychology, and microbiology, guests share how mentorship, teaching, research, and community sustain them. Centered on stories of resistance, belonging, and radical imagination, the podcast reframes academic life through joy rather than struggle, offering accessible role models and new perspectives on equity, diversity, and transformation in higher education.\n",
