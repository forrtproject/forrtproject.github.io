    "abstract": "In order to teach Open and Reproducible Science effectively, educators need to make sense of almost a decade of literature, across several fields, and be informed about ongoing (and often dynamic) debates. This is a tall ask for most educators. So FORRT sought to develop strategies and propose solutions to mitigate the effects of competing academic interests and help scholars implement open and reproducible science tenets in their teaching and mentoring workflow. In an effort to reduce some of the burden on educators wishing to learn or teach these concepts, FORRT has drawn on the expertise of more than 50 experts from its community to provide educators with a comprehensive but straightforward accessible didactic framework. FORRT clusters is a result of a comprehensive literature review guided by educational, pedagogical, and didactic considerations aiming at providing a pathway towards the incremental adoption of Open and Reproducible Science tenets into educators/scholars\u2019 teaching and mentoring. The focus lies not on simply aggregating the literature into bins, but on making sense of existing works, weaving connections where none exist, and providing a sensible learning-oriented Open and Reproducible Science taxonomy. FORRT taxonomy is composed of 9 clusters:\n\n   1. Replicability crisis and credibility revolution knowledge\n   2. Conceptual and statistical knowledge\n   3. Ways of working\n   4. Pre-analysis planning\n   5. Transparency and reproducibility in computation and analysis\n   6. FAIR data and materials\n   7. Publication sharing\n   8. Replication and meta-research\n   9. Academic structures and institutions\n",
