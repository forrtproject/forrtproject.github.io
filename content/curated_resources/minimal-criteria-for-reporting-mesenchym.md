    "abstract": "The widespread application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in veterinary regenerative medicine highlights their promising therapeutic potential. However, the lack of standardized characterization and reporting practices across studies poses a significant challenge, compromising the assessment of their safety and efficacy. While criteria established for human MSCs serve as a foundation, the unique characteristics of animal-derived MSCs warrant updated guidelines tailored to veterinary medicine. A recent position statement outlining minimal reporting criteria for MSCs in veterinary research reflects efforts to address this need, aiming to enhance research quality and reproducibility. Standardized reporting criteria ensure transparency, facilitate evidence synthesis, and promote best practices adoption in MSC isolation, characterization, and administration. Adherence to minimal reporting criteria is crucial for maintaining scientific rigor and advancing the field of veterinary regenerative medicine. Ongoing collaboration among stakeholders is essential for effective implementation and adherence to updated guidelines, fostering excellence and innovation in MSC-based therapies for animal patients.",
