    "abstract": "In his commentary, Klonsky (2024) outlines several arguments for why preregistration mandates (PRMs) will have a negative impact on the field. Klonsky\u2019s overarching concern is that when preregistration ceases to be a tool for research and becomes an indicator of quality itself (a primary example being preregistration badges), it loses its intended benefits. Separate from his concerns surrounding policies like preregistration badges, Klonsky also critiques the practice of preregistration itself, arguing that it can impede our use of other valuable research tools (e.g., multiverse analyses, exploratory analyses). We provide a response to Klonsky\u2019s concerns about preregistration and related policies. First, we provide conceptual clarification on the purpose of preregistration, which was missing in Klonsky\u2019s commentary. Second, with a clearer conceptual framework, we highlight where some of Klonsky\u2019s concerns are warranted, but also highlight where Klonsky\u2019s concerns, critiques, and proposed alternatives to the use of preregistration fall short. Third, with this conceptual understanding of preregistration, we briefly outline some challenges related to the effective implementation of preregistration in psychological science.",
