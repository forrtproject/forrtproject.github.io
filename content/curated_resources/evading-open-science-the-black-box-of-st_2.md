    "abstract": "While Open Science has arguably initiated positive changes at some stages of the research process (e.g., increasing transparency through preregistration), problematic behaviors during data collection are still almost impossible to detect and pose a great risk to the validity and integrity of psychological research\u2014especially, when researchers use data collected by others (e.g., students). Exploring students\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 perspectives, the present registered report enlightens this \u201cblack box\u201d of student data collection, focusing on questionable research practices and research misconduct (QRP/M). The majority of students did not report having engaged in any problematic behaviors during data collection, but some QRP/M\u2014ranging from somewhat questionable to highly fraudulent\u2014seem quite common (e.g., telling participants the hypothesis beforehand, participating in one\u2019s own survey). We provide an overview of students\u2019 reported and supervisors\u2019 suspected data collection QRP/M, explore potential drivers for these behaviors based on the fraud triangle model (including pressures, opportunities, and rationalizations), and report how students and supervisors perceive the eligibility of student data for further uses (e.g., scientific publications). Moreover, we explore the role of the student-supervisor relationship (e.g., communication and expectations) and Open Science practices in student projects. In summary, our findings suggest the potential scientific value of data from student projects. Fostering transparent communication regarding expectations, experiences, and intentions between supervisors and students might further contribute to strengthening this prospect.",
