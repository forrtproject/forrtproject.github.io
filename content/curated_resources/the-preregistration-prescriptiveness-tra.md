    "abstract": "I discuss Van Drimmelen\u2019s (2023) Metascience2023 presentation on researchers\u2019 decision making during the research process. In particular, I consider his evidence that researchers\u2019 discretion over research decisions is unavoidable when they follow research plans that are either overdetermined (i.e., too prescriptive) or underdetermined (i.e., too vague). I argue that this evidence points to a prescriptiveness trade-off when writing preregistered plans: All other things being equal, plans that are more prescriptive are more likely to result in deviations that turn their confirmatory tests into exploratory tests, and plans that are less prescriptive are more likely to result in confirmatory tests that are susceptible to questionable research practices. I also consider Van Drimmelen\u2019s idea that researchers may make unconscious, implicit decisions during the research process. I relate these implicit decisions to Rumsfeld\u2019s (2002) concept of unknown unknowns: \u201cthe things we don\u2019t know we don\u2019t know\u201d! I argue that scientists can report their known knowns (what they know they did and found), and they can be transparent and speculative about their known unknowns (what they know they didn\u2019t do and may find), but that they can\u2019t say much about their unknown unknowns (including their unconscious, implicit decisions) because, by definition, they don\u2019t know what they are! Nonetheless, I think that it\u2019s important to acknowledge unknown unknowns in science because doing so helps to contextualise research efforts as being highly tentative and fallible.",
