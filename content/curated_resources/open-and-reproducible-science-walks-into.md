    "abstract": "Julia Strand is Associate Professor of Psychology at Carleton College and she teaches courses such as Introduction to Psychology, The Psychology of Spoken Words and Sensation and Perception. Julia has also recently prepared and taught a course on Psychology\u2019s Credibility Revolution ( link) which excels in all aspects (e.g., content, creativity, visuals, & functionality).\n\nFORRT has reached out to the academic community on social media to ask which questions other scholars would like Julia to answer about her teaching materials on the Psychology\u2019s Credibility Revolution course (on both technical and non-technical spheres). Below you can find Julia\u2019s answers to these questions. And you can also find in this OSF repository (https://osf.io/zpb8a/) Julia\u2019s complete teaching materials, from which everyone can learn, adapt, or repurpose.\n\nKudos to Julia for preparing such an amazing course and many thanks to her for being so open to partner up with FORRT to share her pedagogies with the wider community. We hope this can serve as an inspiration and help scholars, instructors and educational institutions interested in integrating open and reproducible scholarship tenets in their teaching and mentoring.
