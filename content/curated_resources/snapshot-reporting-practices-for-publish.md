    "abstract": "This checklist is intended to help scientists, reviewers, and editors prepare and assess manuscripts for inclusion of critical details relevant to work with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and tissue stem cells (TSCs) with the goal of increasing the rigor and reproducibility of research through reporting. It is essential that any published paper includes detailed information on the following parameters to increase the transparency of the experimental details and ensure that the published results are reproducible. For additional details on the recommendations, please see the specific sections of the ISSCR\u2019s Standards for Human Stem Cell Use in Research referenced in the checklist (https://www.isscr.org/standards-document). All sections apply to PSCs and TSCs unless otherwise noted. To view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF.",
