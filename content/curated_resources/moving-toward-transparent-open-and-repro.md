    "abstract": "This editorial serves as a brief introduction to this special issue of Prevention Science, entitled \u201cTransparency, Openness, and Reproducibility: Implications for the Field of Prevention Science.\u201d The overall goal of this special issue is to facilitate the engagement of prevention science with the open science movement. Its specific aims are to introduce prevention scientists to transparent and reproducible research practices, provide prevention scientists with worked examples of using these practices, and discuss how prevention scientists can contribute their expertise to advancing the wider open science movement. The manuscripts included in this special issue aspire to stimulate this discourse through a primer on open science for prevention scientists, followed by examinations of replication in prevention and implementation science, study registration and null results in preventive intervention trials, open science and translational prevention research, and applications to prevention research methods.",
