    "abstract": "The preregistration of research plans and hypotheses may prevent publication bias and questionable research practices. We incorporated a modified version of the preregistration process into an undergraduate capstone research course. Students completed a standard preregistration form during the planning stages of their research projects as well as surveys about their knowledge of preregistration. Based on survey results, our senior-level psychology students lacked knowledge of importance of the preregistration movement in the sciences but could anticipate some of its benefits. Our review of the completed preregistration assignment suggested that students struggle with data analysis decision-making but generally perceive preregistration as a helpful planning tool. We discuss the value of a preregistration assignment for generating discussions of research practice and ethics.",
