    "abstract": "Background\nOpen educational resources (OER) are educational materials licensed openly by authors, permitting usage, redistribution, and in some instances, modification. OER platforms thereby serve as a medium for distributing and advancing teaching materials and innovative educational methodologies.\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to determine the present state of OER in otorhinolaryngology and to examine the prerequisites for seamlessly integrating OER into the curricular teaching of medical schools, specifically through the design of two OER blended learning modules.\n\nMethods\nOER content in the field of otorhinolaryngology was analyzed on OER platforms, ensuring its relevance to the German medical curriculum. Data protection concerns were addressed with legal counsel. The blended learning modules were developed in collaboration with medical students and subsequently published as OER.\n\nResults and conclusion\nThis project yielded the first OER from a German ENT department, tailored to the German medical curriculum. One significant barrier to OER use in medicine, more than in other fields, is data protection. This challenge can be navigated by obtaining consent to publish patient data as OER. OER hold the promise to play a pivotal role in fostering cooperation and collaboration among educators, aiding educators in lesson preparation, and simultaneously enhancing didactic quality.",
