    "abstract": "This is an exciting time to be a psychological scientist. There is a major new movement that seeks to promote the credibility and replicability of psychological research by enhancing its transparency, with scholarly societies promoting the principles (http://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/open-science) and groups formed specifically to advance that mission (see http://improvingpsych.org/ and https://cos.io for two examples). While relatively low rates of replicability among scientific findings (Begley & Ellis, 2012; OSC, 2015; Chang & Li 2015) inspired the existence of these groups, in this chapter we describe how striving to maximize transparency in your research can benefit both science and your career.",
