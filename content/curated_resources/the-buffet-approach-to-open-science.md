    "abstract": "We have written about a few of the open science practices, some of which are becoming the norm, such as preregistration (and whether it prevents creativity). I\u2019ve also been invited a few times to give classes and workshops to introduce various audiences to open science and how to implement the practices associated with the overall term (which covers so much more than changing our experimental and publishing habits, but that\u2019s another blog post). Doing so means engaging with researchers from various disciplines, who conduct dramatically different types of studies, and approach science from a different angle than the prototypical theory-testing experimenter. The discussions around open science I had in these contexts have been extremely useful for me, and led me to promote what I call the \u201cbuffet approach\u201d to open science. In short, I think it makes most sense to pick and choose those components and practices from open science that fit a specific project, career stage, personal skills, and institutional support.",
