    "abstract": "This mini course was designed to introduce Psychology undergraduate students at the University of Edinburgh (who are working on their dissertation in the academic year 2021-2022) to open research principles and practices. \nThe course contains 5 videos introducing several core principles of reproducible working which we clustered into the Three T's: Think before you do (about principles of pre-registration), Trace your steps (about detailed record-keeping and version control) and Be Transparent (about adopting a transparent working style and why this is important). \n\nThe videos were created by Dr. Alex Mitchell (Teaching Fellow in Psychology, University of Edinburgh), Niamh MacSweeney (PhD student at the University of Edinburgh & co-organiser Edinburgh ReproducibiliTea) and Laura Klinkhamer (PhD student at the University of Edinburgh & co-organiser Edinburgh ReproducibiliTea).
