    "abstract": "This workshop will introduce students to the process of reproducing published work. Replicating other scholars\u2019 work is an essential tool for becoming familiar with methods, learning to select suitable models, and getting a chance to publish early during their academic career. This replication workshop will therefore provide students with a deeper understanding of statistical modeling and professionalism in their field. With the right amount of value added, a replication study can be submitted to a journal, as has been done by several students in the past.",
