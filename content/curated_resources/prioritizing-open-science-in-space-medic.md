    "abstract": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has recently made a long-term commitment towards fostering open science. The NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS) initiative provides recommendations, best practices, and tools related to open science. The principles of open science include the transparent sharing of data, findings, and methods and is designed to accelerate the pace of discovery and foster collaboration. The goal of open science is to allow data, publications, software, and physical samples to be accessible to all, regardless of being a professional or an amateur. In this paper, we summarize several key points open science that were presented as part of NASA\u2019s Open Science 101 Module 1 at an in-person training event in Washington, D.C., and include how open science can be beneficial for researchers and society as a whole.",
