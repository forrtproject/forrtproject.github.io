    "abstract": "This Registered Report collaborative template aims to address the growing prevalence of Registered Reports. Registered Reports (http://cos.io/rr) are a new publication process now adopted by hundreds of journals across the sciences, in which journal peer review is conducted in two stages. The Stage 1 review is conducted on a pre-registration plan prior to any data collection to arrive at an agreement and an official registration of the plan, with the journal issuing an in-principle acceptance. Stage 2 review ensures that plan has been followed or that deviations have been noted and justified. Registered Report Stage 1 submissions differ from common pre-registration templates in that they look like a regular manuscript, with the following differences: 1) manuscript reflects a future plan, 2) results are written on simulated randomized data or as a data analysis plan, 3) discussion section details planned issues to discuss in Stage 2. This template is meant to structure the manuscript style pre-registration with a very detailed and comprehensive plan that would increase the potential of communicating to reviewers all needed aspects for them to be able to provide constructive helpful feedback. The template has been pre-tested extensively in over 40 submissions of the CORE team (2023) and is continuously updated and improved.
