    "abstract": "Scientific findings often hinge on a single, opaque set of analytical decisions, obscuring how alternative approaches might affect results. The Journal of Robustness Reports (JRR) directly tackles this issue. As a new Diamond Open Access journal, it publishes short, rigorous re-analyses of high-impact studies to explore the robustness of their conclusions. By transparently showing how sensitive results are to different analytical choices, JRR enhances the trustworthiness, transparency, and accessibility of scientific research. It promotes a culture of openness and critical reflection, empowering researchers and the public to better understand the stability of scientific evidence.\n\n",
