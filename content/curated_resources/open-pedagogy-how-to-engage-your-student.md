    "abstract": "Education is not only about learning facts and skills but also about preparing students for active and successful participation in society. Traditional methods of teaching, however, may not always fully engage students or show them how their assignments can make a difference outside the walls of the classroom. In this blog post, we introduce the concept of open pedagogy: a way of teaching that uses novel and innovative resources that put the student at the center of the learning process.",
