It exists as a wiki hosted by the School of Library and Information Science at Simmons University in Boston, USA. The goal is for the open access community itself to enlarge and correct the lists with little intervention from the editors or editorial board. For quality control, editing privileges are granted to registered users. As far as possible, lists are limited to brief factual statements without narrative or opinion.",
