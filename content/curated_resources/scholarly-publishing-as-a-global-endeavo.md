    "abstract": "Each year, the Public Knowledge Project* (PKP) posts a very large, and rather dry, dataset at the Harvard Dataverse Project. This open data provides a summary of the known installations of PKP\u2019s open source publishing software around the world (OJS for journals, OMP for monographs, and OPS for preprints). When we released the data this year, a number of challenging questions were raised about the rapid growth of OJS  in particular \u2013 quite rightly, as \u201copen means open\u201d and that includes being open to interrogation and challenge. But it also means, for many of us, a need for openness as we recalibrate and broaden our understanding of the current scholarly publishing landscape.",
