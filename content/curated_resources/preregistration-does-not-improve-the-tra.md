    "abstract": "One justification for preregistering research hypotheses, methods, and analyses is that it\nimproves the transparent evaluation of the severity of hypothesis tests. In this article, I\nconsider two cases in which preregistration does not improve this evaluation. First, I argue\nthat, although preregistration can facilitate the transparent evaluation of severity in Mayo\u2019s\nerror statistical philosophy of science, it does not facilitate this evaluation in Popper\u2019s theorycentric approach. To illustrate, I show that associated concerns about Type I error rate\ninflation are only relevant in the error statistical approach and not in a theory-centric\napproach. Second, I argue that a preregistered test procedure that allows deviations in its\nimplementation does not provide a more transparent evaluation of Mayoian severity than a\nnon-preregistered procedure. In particular, I argue that sample-based validity-enhancing\ndeviations cause an unknown inflation of the test procedure\u2019s Type I error rate and,\nconsequently, an unknown reduction in its capability to license inferences severely. I\nconclude that preregistration does not improve the transparent evaluation of severity in\nPopper\u2019s philosophy of science or when deviations are allowed.",
