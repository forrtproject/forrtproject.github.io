    "abstract": "In this deep dive session, Amanda Montoya (UCLA) and Karen Rambo-Hernandez (Texas A&M University) introduce the basics of preregistration and Registered Reports: two methods for creating a permanent record of a research plan prior to conducting data collection. They discuss the conceptual similarities and practical differences between pre-registration and registered reports. They provide practical advice from their own experiences using these practices in research labs and resources available for researchers interested in using these approaches. The session concludes with questions and discussion about adopting these practices and unique considerations for implementing these practices in education research.",
