    "abstract": "The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis. Arthritis Inflammation We are studying inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis, and need to analyze the first dozen data sets of their daily inflammation. The data sets are stored in comma-separated values (CSV) format: each row holds information for a single patient, columns represent successive days. The first three rows of our first file look like this: 0,0,1,3,1,2,4,7,8,3,3,3,10,5,7,4,7,7,12,18,6,13,11,11,7,7,4,6,8,8,4,4,5,7,3,4,2,3,0,0 0,1,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,6,10,11,5,9,4,4,7,16,8,6,18,4,12,5,12,7,11,5,11,3,3,5,4,4,5,5,1,1,0,1 0,1,1,3,3,2,6,2,5,9,5,7,4,5,4,15,5,11,9,10,19,14,12,17,7,12,11,7,4,2,10,5,4,2,2,3,2,2,1,1 Each number represents the number of inflammation bouts that a particular patient experienced on a given day. For example, value \u201c6\u201d at row 3 column 7 of the data set above means that the third patient was experiencing inflammation six times on the seventh day of the clinical study. So, we want to: Calculate the average inflammation per day across all patients. Plot the result to discuss and share with colleagues. To do all that, we\u2019ll have to learn a little bit about programming.",
