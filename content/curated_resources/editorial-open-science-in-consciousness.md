    "abstract": "All of us involved in the mind and brain sciences, in whatever\ncapacity, are increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring\nthe credibility of our research. This credibility\u2014which for experimental work turns on its reliability\u2014is particularly salient for\nconsciousness research, given the at-times precarious perception of consciousness science within the wider landscapes of\npsychology and neuroscience (Michel et al. 2019). We are therefore very pleased to introduce a number of \u2018open science\u2019 initiatives that have recently been implemented in Neuroscience of\nConsciousness",
