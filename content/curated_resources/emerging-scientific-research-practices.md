    "abstract": "This course aims to introduce students to current controversies and new developments in recommended scientific practices. The course is meant to help students think critically about how to conduct better empirical research and how to draw better-informed statistical inferences. The course will be conducted in a \u201cseminar meets workshop\u201d style, with a focus on discussion, understanding, and accumulating hands-on experience with different research practices supporting inference. The course covers a range of approaches that aim to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of scientific research. Although many examples will stem from social and personality psychology, this course is appropriate for Ph.D. students across social science disciplines and related fields. Topics will include: \uf0b7Understanding the problem: introduction to the \u201creplication crisis,\u201d developments and debate \uf0b7How issues related to the interpretation of p-values vs. effect sizes and confidence intervals have contributed to the reproducibility issues and the accumulation of knowledge \uf0b7Understand how questionable research practices (QRPs) and publication bias distort the scientific record; learn how to interpret evidence from the scientific literature given these biases (e.g., with the use of p-curve analysis) \uf0b7Recommendations for improving conduct and reporting of research: e.g., pre-registration, open science tools (OSF) and methods, power analysis \uf0b7The future of science and publishing in the new era.",
