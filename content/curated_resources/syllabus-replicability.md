    "abstract": "This course will examine current controversies and new developments in research methods in psychology. The goal of the course is to learn to think critically about how psychological science is conducted and how conclusions are drawn. We will cover both methodological and statistical issues that affect the validity of research in psychology, with an emphasis on social and personality psychology. We will discuss the research process from designing a study to how a study gets published. We will also discuss the recent controversy in psychology about the replicability of scientific results. This course is most suited for students who plan to pursue graduate school in psychology and are preparing for a career conducting research in psychological science.",
