    "abstract": "Registered Reports: Peer review before results are known to align scientific values and practices.\n\nRegistered Reports is a publishing format used by over 250 journals that emphasizes the importance of the research question and the quality of methodology by conducting peer review prior to data collection. High quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication if the authors follow through with the registered methodology.\n\nThis format is designed to reward best practices in adhering to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. It eliminates a variety of questionable research practices, including low statistical power, selective reporting of results, and publication bias, while allowing complete flexibility to report serendipitous findings.\n\nThis page includes information on Registered Reports including readings on Registered Reports, Participating Journals, Details & Workflow, Resources for Editors, Resources For Funders, FAQs, and Allied Initiatives.",
