Our team built upon DOERS3's OER in Tenure & Promotion Matrix to help faculty and staff advocate for the inclusion of open educational practices (OEP) in promotion, tenure, and faculty evaluation practices at their institutions. Below, you can find our main document, directions for interacting with the text, and handouts you can use or adapt for your own advocacy work.",
