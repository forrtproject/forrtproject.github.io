    "abstract": "Psychological research is in the midst of what has been called the \u201creplication crisis\u201d, in which questions have been raised about the validity of even seminal research findings. How can we tell if the research we\u2019re reading and doing is rigorous and reproducible? In this course, we will discuss the controversy around and the replicability of our results, while learning about new initiatives that are reinventing our day-to-day scientific workflow. These include preregistration, open sharing of data and materials, new models of scientific publishing, large-scale open collaborations, and statistical reform. The course will involve hands-on practice implementing cutting-edge tools for conducting open and reproducible research in psychology. \n---We acknowledge that Concordia University is located on unceded Indigenous lands. The Kanien\u2019keh\u00e1:ka Nation is recognized as the custodians of the lands and waters on which we gather today. Tiohti\u00e0:ke/Montr\u00e9al is historically known as a gathering place for many First Nations. Today, it is home to a diverse population of Indigenous and other peoples. We respect the continued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing relationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.",
