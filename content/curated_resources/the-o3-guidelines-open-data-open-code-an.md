    "abstract": "Curated resources that support scientific research often go out of date or become inaccessible. This can happen for several reasons including lack of continuing funding, the departure of key personnel, or changes in institutional priorities. We introduce the Open Data, Open Code, Open Infrastructure (O3) Guidelines as an actionable road map to creating and maintaining resources that are less susceptible to such external factors and can continue to be used and maintained by the community that they serve.",
