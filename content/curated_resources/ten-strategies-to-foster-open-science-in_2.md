    "abstract": "The scientific community has long recognized the benefits of open science. Today, governments and research agencies worldwide are increasingly promoting and mandating open practices for scientific research. However, for open science to become the by-default model for scientific research, researchers must perceive open practices as accessible and achievable. A significant obstacle is the lack of resources providing a clear direction on how researchers can integrate open science practices in their day-to-day workflows. This article outlines and discusses ten concrete strategies that can help researchers use and disseminate open science. The first five strategies address basic ways of getting started in open science that researchers can put into practice today. The last five strategies are for researchers who are more advanced in open practices to advocate for open science. Our paper will help researchers navigate the transition to open science practices and support others in shifting toward openness, thus contributing to building a better science.",
