    "abstract": "This webinar will introduce the concept of version control and the version control features that are built into the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io). The OSF is a free, open source web application built to help researchers manage their workflows. The OSF is part collaboration tool, part version control software, and part data archive. The OSF connects to popular tools researchers already use, like Dropbox, Box, Github and Mendeley, to streamline workflows and increase efficiency. This webinar will discuss how keeping track of the different file versions is important for efficient reproducible research practices, how version control works on the OSF, and how researchers can view and download previous versions of files.",
