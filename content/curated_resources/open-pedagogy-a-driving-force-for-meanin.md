    "abstract": "In this article, we show how the concepts of Open Education and Open Pedagogy make \nlearning more meaningful. We argue that the application of meaningful learning is essential \nin light of current developments in higher education. We do this based on a deepening of \nthe concept of meaningful learning (Chapter 1) and the concepts of Open Education and \nOpen Pedagogy (Chapter 2). We then go on to show how Open Pedagogy contributes to \nmeaningful learning (Chapter 3) and how this can then be applied in the education process \n(Chapter 4). We illustrate this with a number of examples of the application of Open Peda\ngogy in the Netherlands. ",
