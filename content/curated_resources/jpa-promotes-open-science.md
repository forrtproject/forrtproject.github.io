    "abstract": "The scienti\ufb01c endeavor is one in which the capacity to replicate\ufb01ndings is a foundational tenant. It is unfortunate that therehave been a number of highly publicized cases over the pastdecade of scientists who have not practiced science with therequired levels of intellectual integrity. To help address thisproblem, the Center for Open Science (COS) was founded, \u201ctoincrease openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research\u201d(retrieved from https://cos.io/about/mission/ on March 7,2017). As part of their efforts, a series of standards were createdin 2014 under the direction and guidance of recognized disci-pline leaders, journal editors, and funding agency representa-tives. These guidelines were also incentivized, so that authors ofpeer-reviewed research could have their efforts publicly recog-nized for having complied with the newly created standards.",
