    "abstract": "These past two years have shown us the increased need and demand for investments in openness across all areas of research and scholarship -- from content and data to the underlying systems that make those discoveries available and accessible to the world. Invest in Open Infrastructure is an initiative dedicated to improving the funding and resourcing for those underlying technologies and systems. This talk examines higher education's complicated relationship with research infrastructure, and look at critical issues and questions surrounding the tools and providers underpinning open knowledge.",
