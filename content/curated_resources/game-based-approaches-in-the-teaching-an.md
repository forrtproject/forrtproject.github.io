    "abstract": "Game-Based Learning (GBL) is the integration of gaming elements into learning experiences. There are research gaps in GBL for adult learning, in particular for higher order learning outcomes within Higher Education. This leads to a lack of evidence-based approaches for GBL in postgraduate study, where the need for pedagogic innovation has been acknowledged.\n\nThis research comprises 13 publications, 9 supporting outputs (games and toolkits), and a critical reflection. Together they address the research question: \u201cHow can game-based approaches improve the teaching and learning of critical thinking and research skills in Higher Education?\u201d\n\nResearch through Design, within a constructivist paradigm, integrates empirical and theoretical insights to propose evidence-based frameworks for GBL implementation. Publications are contextualised with up-to-date GBL and learning theories appropriate to developing research skills and critical thinking. Results demonstrate significant potential for GBL within research skills training. In particular, creativity, freedom to fail, community building, and personalisation of learning pathways are valuable outcomes of GBL in this context. Barriers to effective use are also analysed. Practical design principles to scaffold design processes are presented. All games and toolkits are freely available and are being used within research development, teaching, and game design communities.\n\nThere are three key contributions to knowledge and practice:\n1. Evidence-based GBL practice for research skills and critical thinking training in HE.\n2. Championing practical, authentic, analogue GBL.\n3. Balancing rigour and usability in GBL co-design workflows.\n\nBalancing theoretical rigour with practicality, this research provides a foundation for effectively integrating GBL into postgraduate learning, and beyond",
