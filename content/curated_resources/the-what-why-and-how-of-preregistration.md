    "abstract": "More researchers are preregistering their studies as a way to combat publication bias and improve the credibility of research findings. Preregistration is at its core designed to distinguish between confirmatory and exploratory results. Both are important to the progress of science, but when they are conflated, problems arise. In this webinar, we discuss the What, Why, and How of preregistration and what it means for the future of science. Visit cos.io/prereg for additional resources.",
