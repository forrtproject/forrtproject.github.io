    "abstract": "Because scientists tend to report only studies (publication bias) or analyses (p-hacking) that \u201cwork,\u201d readers must ask, \u201cAre these effects true, or do they merely reflect selective reporting?\u201d We introduce p-curve as a way to answer this question. P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps < .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves\u2014containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values\u2014only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.
