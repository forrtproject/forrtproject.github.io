    "abstract": "Concerns about the replicability, reproducibility and transparency of research have ushered in a set of practices and behaviours under the umbrella of \u2018open research\u2019. To this end, many new initiatives have been developed that represent procedural (i.e. behaviours and sets of commonly used practices in the research process), structural (new norms, rules, infrastructure and incentives), and community-based change (working groups, networks). The objectives of this research were to identify and outline international initiatives that enhance awareness and uptake of open research practices in the discipline of psychology. A systematic mapping review was conducted in three stages: (i) a Web search to identify open research initiatives in psychology; (ii) a literature search to identify related articles; and (iii) a hand search of grey literature. Eligible initiatives were then coded into an overarching theme of procedural, structural or community-based change. A total of 187 initiatives were identified; 30 were procedural (e.g. toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g. policies, strategies, frameworks) and 87 community-based (e.g. working groups, networks). This review highlights that open research is progressing at pace through various initiatives that share a common goal to reform research culture. We hope that this review promotes their further adoption and facilitates coordinated efforts between individuals, organizations, institutions, publishers and funders.",
