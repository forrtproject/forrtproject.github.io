    "abstract": "In this course, we will introduce you to the world of open science. Perhaps you are familiar with some of the concepts and ideas of open science or maybe the open science movement is completely new to you. Whatever your current understanding is, we believe that what you learn here will be interesting, thought-provoking and useful in your future research career. With this course, Agape would like to open doors for you into the world of open science and introduce various concepts that we think are crucial to high quality research and prior to the opening doors project we were entirely unaware of. Sure, we all heard about scientific integrity and open access publishing at some point in our studies, but the domain of open science encompasses a much larger set of ideas and concepts. Given the sheer extent of open science, this course does not, and could not cover the whole scope of open science. However, we will provide you with a scaffolding to understand the core concepts and signpost you to useful links and resources should you wish to delve deeper and start practising open science in your own work.",
