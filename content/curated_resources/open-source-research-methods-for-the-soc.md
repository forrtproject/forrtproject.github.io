    "abstract": "Welcome! This website has all the materials I use for teaching research methods within the Psychology major at Pitt. I don't use a textbook. I'm making the entire course materials public, and calling this project Open Source Research Methods for the Social Sciences (osRMss). I hope that you find the content useful. I look forward to getting feedback and suggestions and to continually improve osRMss over time.\n\nThis content is made available in full through this Canvas site. In addition, a new feature is that the activities are now available with immediate feedback on both TopHat and H5P\nLinks to an external site.! If you haven't heard of H5P it is a way to create, share, and reuse interactive HTML5 content for teaching purposes. H5P content can be embedded in many of the most common learning management systems and it is open-source. A huge benefit of TopHat H5P over the Word Docs is that multiple choice questions have immediate feedback with explanations. Other sorts of questions often have feedback with links to videos. The TopHat and H5P versions were designed to be nearly identical so you have your choice. The activities on TopHat and H5P are meant to be read alongside Canvas, not on their own. The canvas pages are still necessary for explaining many aspects of the activities in TopHat and H5P.",
