The author, Lisa DeBruine, will be available to answer questions asynchronously on the workshop Slack during the conference, 22-24 September 2022. This guide is aimed at people wanting to start a big team science group from the grassroots, with little or no financial or administrative support. It will cover the organisational aspects of how you recruit members, set up governance, communicate with the team, set up and use social media accounts, use tools for collaboration, and set up a website.",
