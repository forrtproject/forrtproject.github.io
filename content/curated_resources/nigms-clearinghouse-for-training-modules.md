    "abstract": "In January 2014, NIH launched a series of initiatives to enhance rigor and reproducibility in research. As a part of this initiative, NIGMS, along with nine other NIH institutes and centers, issued a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) RFA-GM-15-006 to develop, pilot, and disseminate training modules to enhance data reproducibility. This FOA was reissued in 2018 (RFA-GM-18-002).For the benefit of the scientific community, we will post the products of grants funded by these FOAs on this website as they become available. In addition, we are sharing here other relevant training modules developed, including courses developed from administrative supplements to NIGMS predoctoral T32 grants.",
