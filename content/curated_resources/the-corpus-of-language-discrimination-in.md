    "abstract": "The Corpus of Language Discrimination in Interaction (CLDI) is an open-access, transcribed video corpus capturing real-life instances of language-based discrimination in public spaces. Compiled from citizen recordings and security footage, it showcases how individuals are policed for their language use in everyday contexts like stores, parks, and restaurants. Designed for research, teaching, and community engagement, CLDI provides a unique resource for analyzing how discrimination unfolds in real-time interaction. It supports empirical inquiry, critical reflection, and educational use in fields like sociolinguistics, conversation analysis, and social justice studies.\n\n",
