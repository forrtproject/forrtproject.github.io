    "abstract": "As cities promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transport, this project asks a crucial question: Who is being left behind? Focusing on Amsterdam, the study explores what a just mobility transition looks like by examining the barriers faced by marginalized groups, including disabled people, LGBTQ+ communities, low-income residents, and people of colour. Through interviews with 22 community leaders, the research identifies three key dimensions of exclusion: emotional and sensory stress in traffic, unequal access to resources, and underrepresentation in planning processes. Workshops with municipal staff helped translate findings into practice, promoting more equitable mobility strategies. By challenging infrastructure-centric approaches, this community-engaged project demonstrates that true accessibility requires addressing social and systemic barriers. It offers a model for embedding equity and care into urban mobility planning through a lens of spatial and mobility justice.",
