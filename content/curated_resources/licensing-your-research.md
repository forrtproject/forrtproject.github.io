    "abstract": "Join us for a 30 minute guest webinar by Brandon Butler, Director of Information Policy at the University of Virginia. This webinar will introduce questions to think about when picking a license for your research. You can signal which license you pick using the License Picker on the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io). The OSF is a free, open source web application built to help researchers manage their workflows. The OSF is part collaboration tool, part version control software, and part data archive. The OSF connects to popular tools researchers already use, like Dropbox, Box, Github, Mendeley, and now is integrated with JASP, to streamline workflows and increase efficiency.",
