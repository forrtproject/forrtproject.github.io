    "abstract": "The goal of the NIAID Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) awards is to provide the federal government, scientists, and public health personnel with information and public health tools and strategies needed to control and lessen the impact of epidemic influenza and the increasing threat of pandemic influenza. Additional information about NIAID\u2019s guiding principles of data sharing can be found here.\n\nNIAID recognizes that the data and information obtained through the CEIRR Program will be extremely valuable research resources and that the rapid sharing of these data will be essential in advancing research on influenza and developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. One of the major roles of the iDPCC is to deposit data on behalf of CEIRR to public databases. These include: Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC), NCBI GenBank, and NCBI SRA.",
