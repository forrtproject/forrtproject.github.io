    "abstract": "The .05 boundary within Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST) \u201chas made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move\u201d (to quote Douglas Adams). Here, we move past meta-scientific arguments and ask an empirical question: What is the psychological standing of the .05 boundary for statistical significance? We find that graduate students in the psychological sciences show a boundary effect when relating p-values across .05. We propose this psychological boundary is learned through statistical training in NHST and reading a scientific literature replete with \u201cstatistical significance\u201d. Consistent with this proposal, undergraduates do not show the same sensitivity to the .05 boundary. Additionally, the size of a graduate student\u2019s boundary effect is not associated with their explicit endorsement of questionable research practices. These findings suggest that training creates distortions in initial processing of p-values, but these might be dampened through scientific processes operating over longer timescales.\n\nSignificance statement\nNull Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST) uses p-values to quantify the consistency between observed evidence and the predictions of scientific hypotheses. By arbitrary convention, psychological scientists adopt .05 as the boundary between hypotheses that are \u201cstatistically significant\u201d and those that are not. The pressure to achieve \u201csignificant\u201d results may be one reason why researchers engage in questionable research practices, and one cause for the replication crisis more generally. We investigated whether through statistical training and reading a scientific literature still dominated by NHST, .05 becomes a psychological boundary in the minds of emerging psychological scientists. This was the case. Our findings raise the meta-science question of how the distortions in initial processing of p-values demonstrated here are dampened through the long-term processes of science. They also suggest that competitors to NHST that also include \u201cmagic numbers\u201d may be susceptible to the same problems brought by the .05 boundary.",
