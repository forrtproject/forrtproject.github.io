    "abstract": "In this deep dive session, we introduce the basics of pre-registration: a method for creating a permanent record of a research plan prior to conducting data collection and/or data analysis. We discuss the conceptual similarities and practical differences between pre-registration and registered reports and traditional approaches to educational research. We provide some practical advice from our own experiences using this practice in our own research and resources available for researchers interested in pre-registering their work. Finally, we end with questions and discussion about adopting pre-registration practices and unique considerations for implementing pre-registration in education research.",
