Each primer includes an overview of the topic in the introductory \u201cWhat?\u201d section, reasons for undertaking these practices in the \u201cWhy?\u201d section, followed by a longer \u201cHow?\u201d section that provides guidance on how to do that open research behaviour practically. Throughout the primers there are embedded explanatory weblinks, and at the end of each is a collated list of links to useful further resources.",
