    "abstract": "This workshop demonstrates how using R can advance open science practices in education. We focus on R and RStudio because it is an increasingly widely-used programming language and software environment for data analysis with a large supportive community. We present: a) general strategies for using R to analyze educational data and b) accessing and using data on the Open Science Framework (OSF) with R via the osfr package. This session is for those both new to R and those with R experience looking to learn more about strategies and workflows that can help to make it possible to analyze data in a more transparent, reliable, and trustworthy way.
