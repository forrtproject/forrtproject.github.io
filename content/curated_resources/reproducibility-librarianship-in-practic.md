    "abstract": "As research across domains of study has become increasingly reliant on digital tools (librarianship included), the challenges in reproducibility have grown. Alongside this reproducibility challenge are the demands for open scholarship, such as releasing code, data, and articles under an open license.Before, researchers out in the field used to capture their environments through observation, drawings, photographs, and videos; now, researchers and the librarians who work alongside them must capture digital environments and what they contain (e.g. code and data) to achieve reproducibility. Librarians are well-positioned to help patrons open their scholarship, and it\u2019s time to build in reproducibility as a part of our services.Librarians are already engaged with research data management, open access publishing, grant compliance, pre-registration, and it\u2019s time we as a profession add reproducibility to that repertoire. In this webinar, organised by LIBER\u2019s Research Data Management Working Group, speaker Vicky Steeves discusses how she\u2019s built services around reproducibility as a dual appointment between the Libraries and the Center for Data Science at New York University.",
