    "abstract": "The major aim of Pediatric Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (PENTEC) was to synthesize quantitative published dose/-volume/toxicity data in pediatric radiation therapy. Such systematic reviews are often challenging because of the lack of standardization and difficulty of reporting outcomes, clinical factors, and treatment details in journal articles. This has clinical consequences: optimization of treatment plans must balance between the risks of toxicity and local failure; counseling patients and their parents requires knowledge of the excess risks encountered after a specific treatment.\nStudies addressing outcomes after pediatric radiation therapy are particularly challenging because: (a) survivors may live for decades after treatment, and the latency time to toxicity can be very long; (b) children's maturation can be affected by radiation, depending on the developmental status of the organs involved at time of treatment; and (c) treatment regimens frequently involve chemotherapies, possibly modifying and adding to the toxicity of radiation.\nHere we discuss: basic reporting strategies to account for the actuarial nature of the complications; the reporting of modeling of abnormal development; and the need for standardized, comprehensively reported data sets and multivariate models (ie, accounting for the simultaneous effects of radiation dose, age, developmental status at time of treatment, and chemotherapy dose). We encourage the use of tools that facilitate comprehensive reporting, for example, electronic supplements for journal articles.\nFinally, we stress the need for clinicians to be able to trust artificial intelligence models of outcome of radiation therapy, which requires transparency, rigor, reproducibility, and comprehensive reporting. Adopting the reporting methods discussed here and in the individual PENTEC articles will increase the clinical and scientific usefulness of individual reports and associated pooled analyses.",
