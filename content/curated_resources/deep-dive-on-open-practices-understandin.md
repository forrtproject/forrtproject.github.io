    "abstract": "As sharing data openly becomes more and more the norm, and not just because of mandates for federal funding, more researchers may become more interested in sharing data. Benefits of data sharing for educational research include increased collaboration, acceleration of knowledge through novel and creative research questions, and an increase in equitable opportunities for early career researchers and faculty at under-resourced institutions. In this session, Sara Hart covers the benefits of data sharing as well as the \u201chow to\u201d of how to prepare data for sharing. Participants are provided information about data sharing and resources to support their own data sharing.",
