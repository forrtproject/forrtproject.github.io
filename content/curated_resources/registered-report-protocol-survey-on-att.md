    "abstract": "Background\nPreregistration, the open science practice of specifying and registering details of a planned study prior to knowing the data, increases the transparency and reproducibility of research. Large-scale replication attempts for psychological results yielded shockingly low success rates and contributed to an increasing demand for open science practices among psychologists. However, preregistering one\u2019s studies is still not the norm in the field. Here, we propose a study to explore possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n\nMethods\nIn a mixed-methods approach, an online survey will be conducted, assessing attitudes, motivations, and perceived obstacles with respect to preregistration. Participants will be psychological researchers that will be recruited by scanning research articles on Web of Science, PubMed, PSYNDEX, and PsycInfo, and preregistrations on OSF Registries (targeted sample size: N = 296). Based on the theory of planned behavior, we predict that positive attitudes (moderated by the perceived importance of preregistration) as well as a favorable subjective norm and higher perceived behavioral control positively influence researchers\u2019 intention to preregister (hypothesis 1). Furthermore, we expect an influence of research experience on attitudes and perceived motivations and obstacles regarding preregistration (hypothesis 2). We will analyze these hypotheses with multiple regression models, and will include preregistration experience as control variable.",
