    "abstract": "Beginning in the internet era, the landscape of medical research has undergone a notable evolution. Calls have been made to break down traditional barriers to transparency and open the closed doors of scientific inquiry. At the core of this movement lies the concept of open science\u2014one that advocates for transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in the research process. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines open science as follows: \u201cOpen science is a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable, and sustainable\u201d.1 While open science has gained considerable traction across various disciplines, its application in the realm of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) remains relatively unexplored until now.",
