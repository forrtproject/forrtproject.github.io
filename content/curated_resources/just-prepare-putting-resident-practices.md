    "abstract": "Shaping an effective and just energy transition in underprivileged neighborhoods requires better understanding of both the diversity of household energy practices and how to meaningfully engage residents in renovation planning and implementation. This project addresses those gaps by developing methodological and practical knowledge across four municipalities. It uses that knowledge to co-create solutions in Living Labs\u2014collaborating with municipalities, housing corporations, residents, and other relevant stakeholders. These solutions are then improved iteratively and shared more broadly through a city-wide Learning Lab, engaging additional municipalities, businesses, and community actors to support equitable and inclusive energy transitions elsewhere.",
