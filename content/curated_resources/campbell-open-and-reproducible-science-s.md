    "abstract": "The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with recent developments in open science and reproducibility of the research workflow. By the end of this course students will be familiar with documenting their research workflow (e.g., idea generation, hypotheses, study materials and procedures, re-usable data sets, annotated code, meta-data, output), in both a private and public manner, from beginning to end in a way that allows others to reproduce their methods, analyses, and results. Students will alsobecome familiar with using the Open Science Framework to document their own research workflow.",
