    "abstract": "The Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA) nurtures cross-sector coalitions to tackle the systems-level challenges that are impeding the adoption of open science at scale. \n\nWe are committed to this effort because a more intentional approach to science is a critical component of a more just society. Open science encourages the engagement of diverse voices, perspectives, and expertise. As we face existential global challenges like climate change and pandemics, open science is a critical tool to ensure that both research processes and outcomes are more inclusive, and, by extension, more innovative, efficient, transparent, and trustworthy.",
