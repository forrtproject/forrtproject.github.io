    "abstract": "This repository provides resources for faculty and academic units to re-imagine faculty rewards and incentives, and in particular how faculty are evaluated for promotion and tenure, with the goal of maximizing inclusivity in science by changing how we share our scholarship, data, and research material. \"Impact as Access\" is realized when scholars have access to all aspects of the research pipeline, whether that be through open sharing of research, being directly involved (access as a researcher), or access to education (open education resources). Impact as Access reduces costs by making research reusable, reproducible, and replicable. Impact as Access empowers those from traditionally underserved communities to benefit from publicly funded research. Impact as Access reduces barriers (both financial and social) to participating in advancing science and helping to solve the world's problems.",
