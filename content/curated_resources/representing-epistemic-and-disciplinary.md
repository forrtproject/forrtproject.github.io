    "abstract": "On 10 February 2024, I gave a lightning talk at FOSDEM 2024's Open Research Online Devroom titled \u201cRepresenting epistemological and disciplinary diversity in open research discourse\u201d. It was informed by incredible feedback I received from various open research communities. There's so much good stuff I couldn't fit them into a 10-minute lightning talk, so I'm putting them here.",
