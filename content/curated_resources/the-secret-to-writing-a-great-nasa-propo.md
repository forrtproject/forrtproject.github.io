I\u2019m a 100% soft money-funded research scientist primarily funded by NASA research grants. I teamed with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to lead a $190M NASA proposal. JPL\u2019s mission formulation group provided a lot of help and guidance to our team. What I learned applies to most proposals, whether they are for $100K or $100M.",
