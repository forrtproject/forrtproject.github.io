    "abstract": "A core problem that has been addressed in the scientific reform movement so far is the low rates of reproducibility of research results. Mainstream reform literature has aimed at increasing reproducibility rates by implementing procedural changes in research practice and scientific policy. At the sidelines of reform, theoreticians have worked on understanding the underlying causes of irreproducibility from the ground up. Each approach faces its own challenges. While the mainstream focus on swift practical changes has not been buttressed by sound theoretical arguments, theoretical work is slow and initially is only capable of answering questions in idealized setups, removed from real life constraints. In this article, we continue to develop theoretical foundations in understanding non-exact replications and meta-hypothesis tests in multi-site replication studies, juxtapose these theoretical intuitions with practical reform examples, and expose challenges we face. In our estimation, a major challenge in the next generation of the reform movement is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical advancements.",
