    "abstract": "G\u00e4rtner et al. (2022) propose a system for quantitatively scoring the methodological rigour of papers during the hiring and promotion of psychology researchers, with the aim of advantaging researchers who conduct open, reproducible work. However, the quality criteria proposed for assessing methodological rigour are drawn from a narrow post-positivist paradigm of quantitative, confirmatory research conducted from an epistemology of scientific realism. This means that research conducted from a variety of other approaches, including constructivist, qualitative research, becomes structurally disadvantaged under the new system. The implications of this for particular fields, demographics of researcher, and the future of the discipline of psychology are discussed.",
