    "abstract": "This course is designed to be delivered to master and doctoral students at the Universidade Federaldo Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The structure is organized to (1) provide basic skills to enhance overall transparency and methodological reproducibility, and (2) promote reflection and discussion about open science-not only for simple and good things but also for barriers and some complex issues. Each class requires preparation through reading papers and watching videos. In an ambitious sense, this course aims to compose topics about the philosophy of science, research methods, and useful resources, ultimately targeting more efficient and robust research projects.",
