    "abstract": "This webinar will introduce how to use the Open Science Framework (OSF; https://osf.io) in a Classroom. The OSF is a free, open source web application built to help researchers manage their workflows. The OSF is part collaboration tool, part version control software, and part data archive. The OSF connects to popular tools researchers already use, like Dropbox, Box, Github and Mendeley, to streamline workflows and increase efficiency. This webinar will discuss how to introduce reproducible research practices to students, show ways of tracking student activity, and introduce the use of Templates and Forks on the OSF to allow students to easily make new class projects. The OSF is the flagship product of the Center for Open Science, a non-profit technology start-up dedicated to improving the alignment between scientific values and scientific practices.
