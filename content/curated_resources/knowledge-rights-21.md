    "abstract": "Knowledge Rights 21 (KR21) is focused on bringing about changes in legislation and practice across Europe that will strengthen the right of all to knowledge. It is built on our conviction that the free and open sharing of knowledge is essential for education, innovation and cultural participation, and that everyone should have the possibility to access and use information in both analogue and digital forms. This, in turn, will help Europe deliver on its economic, social, environmental and democratic potential. In order to achieve this goal it is vitally important to enable and facilitate the work of researchers, educators and learners through legislative, regulatory and policy change. This requires the creation of an appropriate information ecology for European citizens, including modern copyright, digital platform and competition laws as well as appropriate investment in digital public research and education infrastructures.",
