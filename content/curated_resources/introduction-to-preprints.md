    "abstract": "This is a recording of a 45 minute introductory webinar on preprints. With our guest speaker Philip Cohen, we\u2019ll cover what preprints/postprints are, the benefits of preprints, and address some common concerns researcher may have. We\u2019ll show how to determine whether you can post preprints/postprints, and also demonstrate how to use OSF preprints (https://osf.io/preprints/) to share preprints. The OSF is the flagship product of the Center for Open Science, a non-profit technology start-up dedicated to improving the alignment between scientific values and scientific practices.
