    "abstract": "The purpose of this document is to provide an aggregated list of games and game-related resources that are relevant to research support services. The term \"research support games\" is here defined to mean any game- or play-based experience that is intended for use as an educational tool for training either researchers or researcher-supporting staff (e.g. librarians and research office teams). These games typically aim to improve research skills or to provide awareness of a topic that is relevant to working as a researcher, such as research data management, open access or copyright.",
