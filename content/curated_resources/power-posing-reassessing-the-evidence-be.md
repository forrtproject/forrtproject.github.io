    "abstract": "A recent paper in Psych Science (.pdf) reports a failure to replicate the study that inspired a TED Talk that has been seen 25 million times. [1] The talk invited viewers to do better in life by assuming high-power poses, just like Wonder Woman's below, but the replication found that power-posing was inconsequential. If an original finding is a false positive then its replication is likely to fail, but a failed replication need not imply that the original was a false positive. In this post we try to figure out why the replication failed.",
