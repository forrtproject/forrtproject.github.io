    "abstract": "Professors Kogevinas and Stayner do not address the central point of my commentary but they do pursue an issue on which I welcome the opportunity to elucidate. As a student of epidemiology myself, I appreciate professors who are more critical of their discipline. Self-satisfaction and complacency cannot fuel the necessary innovation and evolution needed for the new challenges in the field of epidemiology. By all means, celebrate success but do learn from the mistakes. If the professoriate does not raise questions, then others, including thoughtful science writers, will do it for them. Fortunately, awareness of the many problems facing observational epidemiology is increasing.",
