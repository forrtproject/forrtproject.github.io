    "abstract": "This book is not a how-to-do-it manual, so much as a why-to-do-it. Our main goal is to instill in the reader awareness of the numerous sources of bias that can lead to mistaken conclusions when evaluating interventions. Real-life examples are provided with the aim of providing an intuitive understanding of these issues. Of course, it is not much use telling people what not to do if you don\u2019t also give guidance on approaches that are effective. We will illustrate ways in which different research designs can overcome problems, but it is beyond the scope of this book to give detailed instructions on how to implement different methods: instead, we will point readers to other sources that give more in-depth information.\n\nOur focus is on quantitative research methods. Qualitative research methods are increasingly recognized as providing an important complementary perspective on intervention research, by throwing light on the reasons why people - both those receiving intervention and those implementing it - behave as they do. Sometimes it makes more sense to do a qualitative study to refine a research question before diving in using methods that require that everything is converted into numbers (Greenhalgh & Taylor, 1997). If you feel that a quantitative study is missing out on something essential and important about how and why intervention works, this may be an indication that a qualitative study is needed to scope out the problem more fully. Our expertise, however, is with quantitative methods, and our aim is to write a basic explainer of how such studies are designed, and what biases and pitfalls they can involve.\n\nThe intended readership is those who have little or no background in statistics. Lack of statistical training is a massive obstacle to practitioners who want to do intervention research: it not only makes design and analysis of a study daunting, but it also limits what messages the reader can take from the existing literature. This book should be seen as complementing rather than substituting for a technical introduction to statistics. Many readers may be reluctant to study statistics in more depth, but it is hoped that the account given here will give them confidence to approach statistics in the published literature with a more critical eye, to recognize when the advice of a professional statistician is needed, and to communicate more effectively with statisticians. We recommend Russell Poldrack\u2019s open source text Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century as a complement to this book for those who wish to learn more about statistics.\n\nIntervention research is a branch of science, and you can\u2019t do good science without adopting a critical perspective \u2013 to the research of yourself as well as others. We hope this book will make it easier to do that and so to improve intervention research in a range of non-medical fields.",
