    "abstract": "We present a framework designed to help academic institutions and departments rethink and reform academic assessments - including tenure and promotion evaluations - using a values-based approach. For each of the 14 values included, we outline some scoping considerations, representative academic activities or scholarly outputs, and possible behavioral indicators that could embody these values and be evaluated. This framework is not exhaustive, and will likely depend on disciplinary considerations, but we share these examples as a starting point to hopefully encourage reforms. To accompany the framework, we also provide a list of existing resources from other groups that include recommendations for how different elements of this framework (e.g. public engagement) could be assessed.",
