    "abstract": "For any given research area, one cannot tell how many studies have been conducted but never reported. The extreme view of the \"file drawer problem\" is that journals are filled with the 5% of the studies that show Type I errors, while the file drawers are filled with the 95% of the studies that show nonsignificant results. Quantitative procedures for computing the tolerance for filed and future null results are reported and illustrated, and the implications are discussed. ",
