    "abstract": "Medical education has undergone a transformative shift along with the integration of open educational resources (OERs) in recent years. Examining the impact through initiatives like Project Tulip, this article explores how OERs have revolutionized accessibility and collaboration in medical learning. OERs, exemplified by the University of Amsterdam's sharing of e-learning modules, break down financial barriers, making medical education freely accessible. This accessibility fosters personalized, convenient learning for a diverse student population. Unlike commercial publishers, OERs prioritize collaboration, reducing costs and promoting collective development. However, challenges persist in achieving widespread OER adoption, including navigating existing contracts and educator preferences. Quality, availability, and maintenance of open initiatives emerge as critical concerns. Despite these challenges, the shift towards OERs signifies a significant advancement in medical education, emphasizing collaboration, accessibility, and the need for a delicate balance in adoption.",
