    "abstract": "Deep Dive on Open Practices: Understanding Registered Reports in Education Research with Amanda Montoya and Betsy McCoach - Registered reports are a new publication mechanism where peer review and the decision to publish the results of a study occur prior to data collection and/or analysis. Registered reports share many characteristics with preregistration but are distinct by involving the journal prior to completing the study. Journals in the field of education are increasingly offering opportunities to publish registered reports. Registered reports offer a variety of benefits to both the researcher and to the research field. In this workshop, we will discuss the basics of registered reports, benefits and limitations of registered reports, and which journals in education accept registered reports. We provide some practical advice on deciding which projects are appropriate for registered reports, implementing registered reports, and time management throughout the process. We discuss how special cases can be implemented as registered reports, such as secondary data analysis, replications, meta-analyses, and longitudinal studies.",
