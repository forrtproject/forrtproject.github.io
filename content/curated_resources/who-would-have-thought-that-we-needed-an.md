    "abstract": "About two months ago, I published an interview with Richard Poynder in which he discussed his recent announcement that he was \u201csigning off from reporting on open access,\u201d because \u201cthe movement has failed and is being rebranded in order to obscure the failure.\u201d The interview generated lots of comments, and after watching and participating in that discussion, I added an additional comment of my own, observing that I was \u201cgetting the feeling that this post has emboldened some people to speak out who might not have felt able to do so before. And this leads me to wonder: who might be interested in the creation of a forum for multi-perspective, real-time discussion of OA and related issues?\u201d",
