    "abstract": "Objectives\nTo conduct a methodological overview of reviews to evaluate the reporting completeness and transparency of systematic reviews (SRs) of prognostic prediction models (PPMs) for COVID-19.\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nMEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Epistemonikos (epistemonikos.org) were searched for SRs of PPMs for COVID-19 until December 31, 2022. The risk of bias in systematic reviews tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The protocol for this overview was uploaded in the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/7y94c).\n\nResults\nTen SRs were retrieved; none of them synthesized the results in a meta-analysis. For most of the studies, there was absence of a predefined protocol and missing information on study selection, data collection process, and reporting of primary studies and models included, while only one SR had its data publicly available. In addition, for the majority of the SRs, the overall risk of bias was judged as being high. The overall corrected covered area was 6.3% showing a small amount of overlapping among the SRs.\n\nConclusion\nThe reporting completeness and transparency of SRs of PPMs for COVID-19 was poor. Guidance is urgently required, with increased awareness and education of minimum reporting standards and quality criteria. Specific focus is needed in predefined protocol, information on study selection and data collection process, and in the reporting of findings to improve the quality of SRs of PPMs for COVID-19.",
