    "abstract": "Last Contact is a game is a game that is intended to inform people about the open science movement. In the game players encounter common problems of current scientific practice in form of a parody science fiction scenario. The problems that players encounter are just some of the problems that the Open Science Movement tries to solve.\nOpen science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of society, amateur or professional. Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access, encouraging scientists to practice open-notebook science (such as openly sharing data and code, broader dissemination and engagement in science and generally making it easier to publish, access and communicate scientific knowledge.",
