    "abstract": "A viewpoint published in Tourism Management articulates the potential benefits of preregistration and \u2018debunking myths' surrounding this controversial open-science practice (Chen and Li, 2024). This rejoinder critically examines six key arguments presented by Chen and Li (2024) on the benefits of preregistration in tourism research. While acknowledging the potential for enhancing transparency and reducing questionable research practices, we contend that the practical implementation of preregistration presents significant challenges. By exploring both the conceptual ideals and the practical realities, this rejoinder responds to the key arguments for preregistration presented by Chen and Li (2024) and is designed to stimulate further constructive discourse on preregistration in the tourism field.",
