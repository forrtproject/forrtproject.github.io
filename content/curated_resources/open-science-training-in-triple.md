    "abstract": "This case study focuses on the online training activities on Open Science delivered within the H2020 project Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration (TRIPLE, Grant Agreement 863420). The project is dedicated to building a discovery platform for the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) and is committed to promoting and supporting the uptake of Open Science within research practices.\n\nIn order to address SSH research and training communities\u2019 needs for enhanced competencies on Open Science and for stronger support in the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) management of digital training materials, two reusable outputs were produced. The work carried out is presented as a novel approach to tackle the issues related to FAIRifying research and training practices and to create training resources whose reusability and relevance reaches beyond the project lifetime and framework. The case study presents the methods by which the results were produced so as to encourage and enable their future adaptation and reuse.\n\nThe TRIPLE Open Science training series (result 1) targets SSH researchers, research support personnel and infrastructure developers in need of practical tools and specific skills to integrate Open Science practices in their workflows. The training series provides 12 competence-oriented online training events in Open Access whose training materials are available as Open Educational Resources (OER).\n\nThe TRIPLE Training Toolkit (result 2) targets training organisers and research performing organisations who wish to design and manage training events as OERs and increase the impact of their training following good practice. The Toolkit is an easily reproducible workflow designed to help trainers minimise the time they spend in managing training events following FAIR practice. The workflow follows a FAIR-by-design method to address the frequent findability and reusability issues related to the management of digital training resources.",
