    "abstract": "If you follow the headlines, your confidence in science may have taken a hit lately. Peer review? More like self-review. An investigation in November uncovered a scam in which researchers were rubber-stamping their own work, circumventing peer review at five high-profile publishers. Scientific journals? Not exactly a badge of legitimacy, given that the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology recently accepted for publication a paper titled \u201cGet Me Off Your Fucking Mailing List,\u201d whose text was nothing more than those seven words, repeated over and over for 10 pages. Two other journals allowed an engineer posing as Maggie Simpson and Edna Krabappel to publish a paper, \u201cFuzzy, Homogeneous Configurations.\u201d Revolutionary findings? Possibly fabricated. In May, a couple of University of California, Berkeley, grad students discovered irregularities in Michael LaCour\u2019s influential paper suggesting that an in-person conversation with a gay person could change how people felt about same-sex marriage. The journal Science retracted the paper shortly after, when LaCour\u2019s co-author could find no record of the data. Taken together, headlines like these might suggest that science is a shady enterprise that spits out a bunch of dressed-up nonsense. But I\u2019ve spent months investigating the problems hounding science, and I\u2019ve learned that the headline-grabbing cases of misconduct and fraud are mere distractions. The state of our science is strong, but it\u2019s plagued by a universal problem: Science is hard \u2014 really fucking hard.",
