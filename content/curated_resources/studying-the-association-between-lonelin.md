    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between loneliness and support for populist radical right (PRR) parties. Drawing on data from over 40,000 individuals across nine European countries, the researchers conducted 25 preregistered analyses and found that lonelier individuals in the Netherlands were more likely to support PRR parties. By openly sharing data (where possible) and analysis code, the project exemplifies transparent, reproducible research and offers valuable insights into the emotional drivers of political behavior.",
