    "abstract": "This course will acquaint students with the major research designs and procedures in social psychology, as well as explore recent methodological innovations that were designed to address issues unique to social psychological research. The objectives are to develop a firm grasp of the research methods available, including the application of these methods in research settings, and statistical considerations of these methods. A consideration of how we \u201cdo\u201d science is a theme permeating the entire class (e.g., research transparency, replicability of research findings). \nTopics to be covered include, but are not limited to, transparency of the research process and the replicability of research findings, validity and reliability, mediation and moderation, field research, modelling interdependence (data from groups of 2 or more), multi-level modelling, methods for the study of social cognition, and meta-analysis.
