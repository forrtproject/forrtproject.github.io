    "abstract": "Answering the question of what fraction of a journal\u2019s papers were previously available as a preprint is quite difficult to do. The tricky part is matching preprints (from a number of different servers) with the published output from a journal. The easy matches are those that are directly linked together, the remainder though can be hard to identify since the manuscript may change (authors, title, abstract) between the preprint and the published version.\n\nA strategy by Crossref called Marple, that aims match preprints to published outputs seems like the best effort so far. Their code and data up to Aug 2023 is available. Let\u2019s use this to answer the question!",
