    "abstract": "How can we objectively define categories of truth in scientific thinking? How can we reliably measure the results of research? In this ground-breaking text, Dienes undertakes a comprehensive historical analysis of the dominant schools of thought, key theories and influential thinkers that have progressed the foundational principles and characteristics that typify scientific research methodology today. This book delivers a masterfully simple, \u2018though not simplistic\u2019, introduction to the core arguments surrounding Popper, Kuhn and Lakatos, Fisher and Royall, Neyman and Pearson and Bayes. Subsequently, this book clarifies the prevalent misconceptions that surround such theoretical perspectives in psychology today, providing an especially accessible critique for student readers. ",
