    "abstract": "Background and Objectives\nGiven the increase in methodological pluralism in research on brain health, cognitive aging, and neurodegenerative diseases, this scoping review aims to provide a descriptive overview and qualitative content analysis of studies stating the use of participatory research approaches within Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias (ADRD) literature globally.\n\nResearch Design and Methods\nWe conducted a systematic search across four multidisciplinary databases (CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycInfo, PubMed) for peer-reviewed, English-language studies addressing ADRD that explicitly described their use of a participatory research approach. We employed a systematic process for selecting articles that yielded a final sample of 163 studies. Data from articles were analyzed to chart trends from 1990 to 2022 in terminology, descriptions, application of participatory approaches, and the extent and nature of partnerships with nonacademics.\n\nResults\nResults demonstrated geographic differences in the use of stated approaches between North America\u2014where community-based participatory research predominates\u2014and Europe, where Action Research is most common. We further found that only 73% of papers in this systematic review had identifiable definitions or descriptions of the participatory approach used. Findings also showed that 14% of articles demonstrated no evidence of engaged partnership beyond activities typical of research participants, while 23% of articles identified partnering with people with dementia, and an additional 16% reported partnerships with members from Indigenous, Black, Asian, or Latinx communities.\n\nDiscussion and Implications\nThis scoping review identifies three areas in need of greater attention in ADRD literature using participatory research approaches. First, findings indicate the importance of strengthening the use, transparency, and rigor of participatory methods. Second, results suggest the need for greater inclusion of historically marginalized groups who are most affected by ADRD as research partners. Finally, the findings highlight the need for integrating social justice values of participatory approaches into research project designs.",
