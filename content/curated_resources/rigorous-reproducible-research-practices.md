    "abstract": "How do you know whether the quantitative research you\u2019re consuming and producing is rigorous and reproducible? This course will draw on contemporary perspectives to help you answer this question. We'll discuss the whys and hows of statistical inference and transparent research practices (e.g., sample size planning, preregistration, sharing data and materials), and best practices for reporting and evaluating research. We'll also consider thorny issues surrounding conducting and evaluating replication research, giving and responding to scientific criticism, and the everyday incentives that shape scientists' behavior. Students will come away having developed a principled understanding of relevant concepts and a set of concrete tools for producing and consuming high quality science. ",
