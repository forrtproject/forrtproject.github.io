    "abstract": "Research is cumulative. New investigations build on, challenge, or qualify claims based on prior evidence. When we have limited evidence, it is normal that some explanations are wrong and need to be refined or reconsidered. This self-corrective process is a hallmark of research. A key part of a healthy self-corrective process is that the evidence used for generating and refining explanations is credible and trustworthy. A weak foundation of evidence allows explanations to be generated that describe phenomena that are not occurring as well as inaccurate explanations of phenomena that do occur. We have made much progress in evaluating the credibility of the evidence foundation in research, and these investigations suggest that there is substantial room to improve the credibility and trustworthiness of research (1). If we can improve the foundation of evidence upon which explanations are built and debated, then we might dramatically accelerate the pace of discovery of knowledge, treatments, and solutions in service of humanity.",
