    "abstract": "The information provided on this website is designed to assist the extramural community in addressing rigor and transparency in NIH grant applications and progress reports. Scientific rigor and transparency in conducting biomedical research is key to the successful application of knowledge toward improving health outcomes. \n\nDefinition Scientific rigor is the strict application of the scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results. \n\nGoals The NIH strives to exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science. Grant applications instructions and the criteria by which reviewers are asked to evaluate the scientific merit of the application are intended to: \n\u2022 ensure that NIH is funding the best and most rigorous science, \n\u2022 highlight the need for applicants to describe details that may have been previously overlooked, \n\u2022 highlight the need for reviewers to consider such details in their reviews through updated review language, and \n\u2022 minimize additional burden.",
