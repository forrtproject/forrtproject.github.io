    "abstract": "In this talk, Professor Corker shows how researchers are typically evaluated and contrasts that with ideal ways to evaluate the process of scientific output. Funding for open practices, infrastructure, and publication decisions made regardless of outcome incentivize the type of science we want to see occur. \n---\nAre you a funder interested in supporting research on the scientific process?
