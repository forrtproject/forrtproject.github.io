    "abstract": "Objectives\nDespite the growing importance of bioinformatics in molecular diagnostics, not all medical laboratory sciences (MLS) programs provide instruction in this field. We developed and assessed a virtual laboratory learning unit to introduce basic bioinformatics concepts and tools to MLS students.\n\nMethods\nThe unit included a video tutorial, written instructions for the online laboratory activity, and a postactivity review video. The effectiveness of the instruction was evaluated using preassessment and postassessment questions, performance of the online tasks, and a survey assessing the students\u2019 attitudes toward the learning unit.\n\nResults\nA prototype of the module was tested with 32 graduate and undergraduate students. Modifications were made based on the pilot test results and student feedback, and the refined version was subsequently evaluated with a different group of 20 undergraduate students. The participants responded favorably to the learning unit and successfully achieved the learning objectives, gaining familiarity with fundamental bioinformatics concepts and terminology, effectively employing basic computational tools, and developing an appreciation for the field.\n\nConclusions\nOur learning unit is a promising tool for introducing MLS students to the field of bioinformatics. As an open educational resource, it has the potential to be integrated into molecular biology education for MLS programs anywhere.",
