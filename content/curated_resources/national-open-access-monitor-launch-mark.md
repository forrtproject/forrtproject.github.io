    "abstract": "The National Open Research Forum (NORF), the Irish Research eLibrary (IReL), and OpenAIRE proudly announce the launch of the National Open Access Monitor, a cornerstone in Ireland's shift towards a fully open access research ecosystem. This launch marks a significant phase in a project that began months ago, following OpenAIRE's selection through a competitive tendering process. This initiative aims to support the shift towards transparency and accessibility of Irish research publications, and tracking Ireland\u2019s goal of 100% of publicly funded research being open access by 2030. For more information on this project, please also read the national press release from July 2023.",
