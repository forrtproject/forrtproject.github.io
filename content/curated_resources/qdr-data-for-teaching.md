    "abstract": "As part of its mission, QDR promotes the pedagogical use of published qualitative and multi-method data projects. Shared qualitative data can play a crucial role for both substantive and methods teaching. Below is a non-exhaustive list of projects we want to highlight as being particularly well-suited for secondary uses by undergraduate and graduate students. They all\n\n- Allow unrestricted access to data (after free website registration)\n- Are well documented so data is understandable\n- Are rich in content to allow deep engagement and the pursuit of a variety of questions\n- Are mostly in English for widest usability.\n- The projects are listed by data type and include a short description. For additional details, simply click through to the project page in our data catalog.",
