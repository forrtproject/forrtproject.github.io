    "abstract": "The Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences (FABBS) is a coalition \nof 29 scientific societies and 60 academic departments that come together to \nadvance the rigor, impact, equity, and accessibility of our disciplines. To these ends, \nFABBS champions the principles and practices of open science.  \n \nAs a coalition, FABBS has an opportunity to foster discipline-specific norms and good \npractices. FABBS is pleased to provide the following guidance on a range of open \nscience-related activities. We hope that this statement will serve as a tool to calibrate \nlanguage and further the conversation. Accordingly, FABBS has created and will \ncontinue to grow the FABBS Open Science Hub.  ",
