## **Summary**

<br>

Replications of previous scientific work are at the core of the Open Scholarship movement. However, as replication efforts become more widespread, it can be challenging to scholars and educators to keep themselves up to date with which effects in their field replicate and which do not. FORRT’s replications and reversals aims to collate replications and specifically so-called reversal effects in social science. Reversals are—in the context of a replication—effects that have their original direction flipped. The extent of such reversals and non-replicated effects is already apparent in the social science literature, with even replicated effects being only half of the originally reported effect (Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although such failures to replicate are far less costly to society than for example medical ones (Prasad & Cifu, 2011), they broadly hinder science's goal of accumulating knowledge and contribute to waste of scarce resources. This resource aims to be a “living”, freely available, crowd-sourced, and community-driven collection of effects that have either not been replicated or even reversed through empirical research across social sciences. Scholars from varied backgrounds and areas of social science are invited to contribute with prevalent effects in their respective fields.

<br>

## **Motivation**

The purpose of collating these reversal effects in social science is to encourage educators to incorporate replications of these effects into their students' project (e.g., third-year, thesis, course work) to provide them the opportunity to experience the research process directly, assess their ability to perform and report scientific research, and to help evaluate the robustness of the original study, thereby also helping them become good consumers of research. The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
* Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
* Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
* Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
* Building capacity for advocacy; and
* Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

<br>

## **Current Status**

This is a dynamic project that is organized in four stages for its 1st Phase. Currently, we are in stage 2 of phase 1: 

1. **~~Proof of Concept Phase (adaptation of original project into FORRT, inclusion of effects from social and cognitive psychology, using Gavin Leech’s collection as a basis) → ~150 entries finished in 2021.~~**

1. **Team Science Expansion Phase Across Disciplines** (crowd-sourcing entries and refine existing entries), started at the end of 2021 and planned until the end of **June 2022.** Draft first ‘output’ piece.

1. **Review Phase** (open review to identify inconsistencies, missing data, and errors), planned for the end of 2022. Finish first ‘output’ piece. End of Phase 1.

1. Regular **Update Phases** (dynamically adding new effects), planned for 2023 and beyond.

## **Social Psychology**

No good evidence for [many forms of priming](https://replicationindex.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/), automatic behavior change from ‘related’ (often only metaphorically related) stimuli. Semantic priming is still solid, but the [effect lasts only seconds](http://laplab.ucsd.edu/articles/RohrerPashlerHarris2015JEPG.pdf).

* **Elderly priming**. Hearing about old age makes people walk slower. [The p-curve alone](https://psyarxiv.com/3m5y9) argues against the first 20 years of studies.

* **Stanford Prison Experiment** (SFE) employed a simulation of a prison environment to  examine the psychological effects of coercive situations. Utilizing role-playing, labeling and social expectations it showed that one third of participants in the role of prison guards displayed aggressive and dehumanizing behavior.
{{< spoiler text="Statistics" >}}
* Status: NA
* Original paper: '[Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison](http://pdf.prisonexp.org/ijcp1973.pdf)', Haney, Banks, Zimbardo (1973)  [n= 24 citations (including highly referenced publications) = [2115](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=9776461194085021745), (GS, January, 2022)].
* Critiques: First, the study has been criticized for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behavior of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behavior of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role.

* **Milgram experiment** was a study examining the influence of authority on the immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks of 15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock od 450 V.

Burger (n=70) also finds similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods (see Table 5: the only real order among the prompts led to universal disobedience), so whatever was going on, it's not obedience. [One selection of follow-up studies](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.7724&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.) The most you can say is that there's weak evidence for compliance, rather than obedience. ("Milgram's interpretation of his findings has been largely rejected.")

* Critiques:  No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported. Set aside the ethics: the total absence of consent - the boys and parents had no idea they were in an experiment - or the plan to set the forest on fire and leave the boys to it.

The effect has been interpreted by the author as evidence for the prevalence of independence (“_The preponderance of judgments was independent, evidence that under the present conditions the force of the perceived data far exceeded that of the majority._”, Asch, 1956, p.24). Nevertheless, the majority of academic textbooks present the study as evidence for overwhelming conformity, failing to report the evidence of independent tendencies among participants(see: Friend et al., 1990, Griggs, 2015). A common practice seen in many academic textbooks and popular writings is to report the value of “75%” or “76%” as the general indicator of conformity. In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

* No good evidence that taking a **“power pose”** lowers cortisol, raises testosterone, risk tolerance. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.

* Replication effect size: 
  * Meta-analytic estimate: d= 0.2 [0.14, 0.26]. No evidence of publication bias but d = 0.2 and targeting 80% to detect a real phenomenon one needs more than 500 participants. All included studies have only less than 100.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> [Schimmack](https://replicationindex.com/2017/09/04/the-power-of-the-pen-paradigm-a-replicability-analysis/)</span> finds strong evidence of publication bias on a subset of these papers, using a proper power analysis. 98 pieces of very weak evidence cannot sum to strong evidence, whatever the p-value says.

* Original effect size: No sds reported so I don't know. 2 of the 4 experiments showed a positive relationship between score and perceived ability; 2 showed no strong relationship. And the best performers tended to underestimate their performance. [This replicates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289620300271): the correlation between your IQ and your assessment of it is around r ≃ 0.3.

(5) is much shakier than (1). The original paper concedes that there's a [purely statistical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect#Mathematical_critique) explanation for (1): just that it is much easier to overestimate a low number which has a lower bound! And the converse: if I am a perfect performer, I am unable to overestimate myself. D&K just think there's something notable left when you subtract this. \

* Replication effect size (for claim 1): 3 of the 4 original studies can be explained by noisy tests, bounded scales, and artefacts in the plotting procedure. ("the primary drivers of errors in judging relative standing are general inaccuracy and overall biases tied to task difficulty".) Only about 5% of low-performance people were very overconfident (more than 30% off) in the Nuhfer data
* Gignac & Zajenkowski use IQ rather than task performance, and run two less-confounded tests, finding  r = −0.05  between P and errors, and r = 0.02  for a quadratic relationship between self-described performance and actual performance

* **Music lessons improve intelligence**. An original experimental study found an increase in IQ for children who received a year of music lessons, compared to children who were randomly assigned to drama lessons or no lessons. Later studies did not replicate this when comparing music lessons to other forms of training such as dance lessons. However, observational studies do suggest that adult musicians have enhanced cognitive abilities compared to non-musicians or even bilinguals ([D’Souza et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-018-0095-6)), but this work is correlational, and one possible reason of such positive effects is that the personality traits of people who self-select into long-term music training (e.g., conscientiousness) also drives them to success in other areas. ​ This finding is a good case study of the problem of miscommunication of scientific research in the press ([Mehr, 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00988/full)), because the original study has not been replicated in over five attempts, yet it continues to be cited and used by the media and educators.

## **Judgment and Decision Making**

In general, the replication success rate of Judgment and Decision Making (JDM) is decent, 68% according to [Collaborative Open-science Research (2022) led by Dr. Gilad Feldman](https://mgto.org/pre-registered-replications/), **a mass replication project**. That said, similar to other subfields in social sciences, many effects are overestimated and there are publication biases.

* The effect of **“nudges”** (choice architecture that promotes beneficial decisions) may be exaggerated in general. [One comprehensive review](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27594/w27594.pdf) by DellaVigna and Linos (2020) found average effects by Nudge Units were six times smaller than studies published in academic journals. (Not saying there are no big effects.), see another [systematic review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bdm.2035) by Szaszi et al. (2018) as well as [Hummel and Maedche (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804318303999).

* Identifiable **victim effect** is much weaker and less robust than previously thought, with lots of mixed findings, failed replications, null findings and numerous boundary conditions. See [Lee and Feeley (2016) meta-analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891), with _r_ = .05.

Above-and-below-average effects arise when comparing oneself to others, whereby people rate themselves as above average for easy abilities and below average for difficult abilities. All standardized beta-values from multiple regression predicting judgmental weight of own and others’ abilities from mean comparative ability estimates in different ability domains were consistent with the original. Additionally, different statistical tests resulted in slightly smaller effects in the same direction of the original.

These include flashy results about increased portion size massively reducing satiety. 

* **Choice overload**, the idea that giving people too many choices can lead to certain undesirable consequences such as reduced purchasing intentions, is in doubt, but most people don’t consider it to be discredited. 
{{< spoiler text="Statistics" >}}
* Status: Mixed (dueling meta-analyses, mix of successful and failed replications). It would probably require a systematic, multi-lab replication approach to sort this out at this point.

In the original field experiment with exotic jams where # flavors were manipulated (24 vs. 6), more stopped to browse the larger selection (60% vs 40%), but more purchased from the smaller selection (30% (31) vs. 3% (4)) (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). 3 experiments with n=249,193,. [citations=4897(GS,October 2021)].
* Failed replications: Scheibehenne (2008) failed to directly replicate Iyengar and Lepper (2000) jam study. Greifeneder (2008) did a lab experiment with chocolates and also failed to conceptually replicate. These replication failures are not definitive because there have been many studies (too many to list) in which the effect was (conceptually) replicated in some fashion.
* Meta-analyses: 
  * [Scheibehenne et al. 2010](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/37/3/409/1827647): “We found a mean effect size of virtually zero” (d=.02) [citations=1049(GS,October 2021)].
  * Chernev et al. 2010: That’s because many of the studies were designed to show instances when there is no effect. You need to split the data into “choice is good” vs. “choice is bad.”
  * Simonsohn et al. 2014: We agree with Chernev et al. (2010). When we split it up, we found that the choice is bad studies (choice overload) lack collective evidential value (uniform _p_-curve).

Study 4: N=75; the activation of a mate guarding motive increases women’s spending on luxurious accessories, but only when these accessories are visible to other women.

They found self-esteem was not related to smoking, alcohol, drug use; seemed to be only minimally associated with interpersonal success; Relationship with school performance seems to be that better school performance leads to higher self-esteem rather than the other way around. Self-esteem was moderately correlated with depression.

Test has some merit in detecting thinking disorders (although this is thought to be non-projective rather than projective which is meant to be the intention of the test; Dawes 1994) but is not related to other conditions such as depression, anxiety, antisocial personality disorder. Garb 1998, Lilienfeld et al. 2006. These indicate that clinicians with access to questionnaire data or life histories of patients use data from the Rorschach test, their predictive accuracy actually decreases, possibly because they place more weight on the Rorschach results which are lower quality than data from other sources.
