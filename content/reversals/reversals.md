## **Summary**

<br>

Replications of previous scientific work are at the core of the Open Scholarship movement. However, as replication efforts become more widespread, it can be challenging to scholars and educators to keep themselves up to date with which effects in their field replicate and which do not. FORRT’s replications and reversals aims to collate replications and specifically so-called reversal effects in social science. Reversals are—in the context of a replication—effects that have their original direction flipped. The extent of such reversals and non-replicated effects is already apparent in the social science literature, with even replicated effects being only half of the originally reported effect (Ioannidis, 2005; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although such failures to replicate are far less costly to society than for example medical ones (Prasad & Cifu, 2011), they broadly hinder science's goal of accumulating knowledge and contribute to waste of scarce resources. This resource aims to be a “living”, freely available, crowd-sourced, and community-driven collection of effects that have either not been replicated or even reversed through empirical research across social sciences. Scholars from varied backgrounds and areas of social science are invited to contribute with prevalent effects in their respective fields.

<br>

## **Motivation**

The purpose of collating these reversal effects in social science is to encourage educators to incorporate replications of these effects into their students' project (e.g., third-year, thesis, course work) to provide them the opportunity to experience the research process directly, assess their ability to perform and report scientific research, and to help evaluate the robustness of the original study, thereby also helping them become good consumers of research. The below crowdsourced and community-curated resource aims to satisfy three of [FORRT’s Goals](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Support scholars in their efforts to learn and stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research;
* Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution;
* Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and its pedagogies.

and four of [FORRT’s Mission](https://forrt.org/about/mission/):

* Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service;
* Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
* Building capacity for advocacy; and
* Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources.

<br>

## **Current Status**

This is a dynamic project that is organized in five stages. Currently, we are in stage 3: 

1. **~~Proof of Concept Phase (adaptation of original project into FORRT, inclusion of effects from social and cognitive psychology, using Gavin Leech’s collection as a basis) → ~150 entries finished in 2021.~~**

1. ~~**Team Science Expansion Phase Across Disciplines** (crowd-sourcing entries and refine existing entries), started at the end of 2021. Drafting of first ‘output’ piece. Currently including a total of 600+ effects spanning 22 disciplines.~~

1. **Database'ification and merging**, converting the spreadsheet and all effects into a meta-analytic database and merging it with existing replication databases. Planned until beginning of 2024.

1. **Review Phase** (open review to identify inconsistencies, missing data, and errors), planned for 2024. Publishing of first ‘output’ piece.

1. Regular **Update Phases** (dynamically adding new effects), planned for 2025 and beyond.

* Original effect size: Key claims were insinuation plus a battery of difference in means tests at up to 20% significance(!). _n_ = 24, data analysis on 21.
* Replication effect size: N/A. First, the study has been criticised for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behaviour of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behaviour of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role.

* **Milgram experiment** was a study examining the influence of authority on the immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks of 15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V.

Doliński et al.: comparable effects to Milgram. Burger: similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods. Blass: average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.) The most you can say is that there's weak evidence for compliance, rather than obedience. ("Milgram's interpretation of his findings has been largely rejected.").

* Original effect size: N/A. Not reported in conventional format. (Rationale: "results obtained through observational methods were cross-checked with results obtained through sociometric technique, stereotype ratings of in-groups and outgroups, and through data obtained by techniques adapted from the laboratory. Unfortunately, these procedures cannot be elaborated here.")
* Replication effect size: N/A. Various sources (Billig, Perry, Tavris): No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported. Set aside the ethics: the total absence of consent - the boys and parents had no idea they were in an experiment - or the plan to set the forest on fire and leave the boys to it.

Criticism focuses on the fact that textbooks exaggerate and misquotate evidence of conformity and omit or diminish evidence of independence.
* Original effect size: 36.8% of the responses were incorrect (influenced by the majority). The effect has been interpreted by the author as evidence for the prevalence of independence (“_The preponderance of judgments was independent, evidence that under the present conditions the force of the perceived data far exceeded that of the majority._”, Asch, 1956, p.24). 
* Replication effect size: Bond and Smith: _d_ = .92[.89-.96], average rate of incorrect answers: 25%. Friend et al./Griggs: The majority of academic textbooks present the study as evidence for overwhelming conformity, failing to report the evidence of independent tendencies among participants. A common practice seen in many academic textbooks and popular writings is to report the value of “75%” or “76%” as the general indicator of conformity. In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

* **Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm**. Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​

* **Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm**. In this paradigm, subjects are led to perform, in a context of free choice, an inconsistent act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act). Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, etv.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​

* **Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​

Vicarious cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; see “personal cognitive dissonance”), suggests that it would be possible for an individual to experience dissonance _vicariously_ when they witness the performance of inconsistent act (e.g., counter-attitudinal or counter-normative behaviour) on the part of an in-group member with whom they strongly identify. As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice. Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, etc.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​

* **Vicarious cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, subjects are made to observe a member of their group becoming aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​

* **Ability EI as a factor of intelligence**. Ability EI is a collection of cognitive abilities relating to the recognition, understanding and management of emotions. There have been many controversies in attempting to contextualise Ability EI within models of intelligence/cognitive ability. MacCann et al. (2014) empirically tested multiple models of how various cognitive abilities interact, including hierarchical and bi-factor models, and the data demonstrated closest fit to a hierarchical structure where Ability EI was contextualised as a second-stratum factor. A recent replication repeated this modelling process and drew the same conclusion.

* **Age of acquisition influences the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (progressive demasking)**. Early-acquired items are identified more accurately than late-acquired items, using a progressive demasking task. A progressive demasking task is a type of perceptual identification task where participants are presented with a series of words that are gradually revealed over time and their ability to identify words at each stage of the task is measured. Words learned at an earlier age are thought to be easier to demask than those learned later in life, perhaps because the individual has gained more experience and exposure to the word, which can make it easier to recognize.

* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (anagram solution)**. Age of acquisition is thought to affect lexical retrieval through its impact on anagram (word jumbles) solutions, such that words acquired at an earlier age tend to be solved more quickly and accurately in anagram tasks than those learned later in life. This may be because words learned earlier in life are more deeply encoded and may therefore be more easily accessed.

* **Age of acquisition influence on the post-lexical stages of lexical retrieval** (delayed spoken picture naming). Early-acquired words should not differ from late-acquired words in terms of accuracy and response speed of spoken naming, when using a delayed picture naming task that requires participants to name a picture a few seconds (e.g. 2-4 sec) after seeing the actual picture. This task enables researchers to assess if any possible delay of naming effects result at an articulatory level, as opposed to a conceptual level or lexical retrieval stage.

* **Age of acquisition influence on speeded phonological retrieval** (transparent language). Early-acquired words are responded to more quickly and accurately than late-acquired words, using a speeded naming paradigm, where participants must name the items as quickly as possible within a short timeframe (e.g. 400 milliseconds). This effect is argued to reduce the influence of semantics on phonological activation, which is argued to accumulate over the word naming process.

* **Motor priming**. Motor priming refers to the phenomenon where a previous motor action influences the subsequent execution of a motor task. Scientific findings have shown that motor priming can have a moderate to large effect on task performance. It's also important to note that the effect size of motor priming can depend on the specific task being used, the population being studied, and the experimental design.

* **Flanker task**. The Flanker task is a measure of inhibition of prepotent responses. Response times to target stimuli flanked by irrelevant stimuli of the opposite response set (incongruent) are significantly more impaired than when they are flanked by irrelevant stimuli of the same response set (congruent).

* **Placebo Effect.** Refers to the phenomenon in which a treatment or intervention that has no specific therapeutic effect (such as a sugar pill or saline injection) can still produce a therapeutic response in some individuals. The concept of the placebo effect can be traced back to the 18th century, when physicians and researchers began to notice that patients often reported improvements in their symptoms after receiving treatments that did not have any known physiological effects.

* **Disfluency effect**. Disfluency, the subjective experience of difficulty associated with cognitive operations, leads to deeper cognitive processing. If information is processed with difficulty or disfluently (e.g. when written in hard-to-read fonts), this experience serve as a cue that the task is difficult or that one’s intuitive (System 1) response is likely to be wrong, thereby activating more elaborate (System 2) processing, resulting in more positive cognitive outcomes.​

* **Decoy effect** (alternatives: asymmetric dominance; attraction effect). The Decoy Effect is a cognitive bias in which an individual's preference between two options is influenced by the presence of a third, asymmetrically dominated  option (i.e., a decoy similar but inferior to one of the original options). Individuals are more likely to choose the option that is similar to the decoy option than if the decoy were absent. Decoy effect has been replicated in different studies and contexts, though the magnitude of the effect can vary, particularly depending on the specific features of the options being considered and the context in which the decisions are being made.

* **Risky Choice Framing Effect** (term used by Levin et al., 1998), alt-term = framing effect in risky-decision making. Under loss-frame, people are risk-seeking, whereas under gain-frame, people are risk-averse. In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied ([Kühberger, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.1998.2781)). In risky choice problems, the way a choice is presented influences the decision. (e.g. saving 10 people out of 100 vs losing 90 people out of 100).

* **Risk and Goal Message Framing.** a) For illness detection behaviors, loss framing (presenting information of negative consequences with undesirable behaviors / without desirable behaviors) would be more effective than gain framing (presenting information of benefits through engaging in desirable behaviors) in encouraging healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors (perhaps because illness detection behaviors are riskier, Rothman & Salovey, 1997), whereas b) for health-affirming behaviors, gain framing would be more effective than loss framing in motivating healthy attitudes, intentions, behaviors (perhaps because health-affirming behaviors are less risky, Rothman & Salovey, 1997).

* **Money market versus goods/social market**. The money market relationship refers to an exchange in which effort level is determined based on the level of compensation. By contrast, the social market relationship is an exchange in which effort level is most influenced by altruistic motivations rather than the compensation level. Heyman and Ariely (2004) proposed and showed that when the former is primed with monetary compensation, the more compensation they receive, the more effort they displayed. Yet, effort level did not vary depending on the level of compensation when the latter is primed with non-monetary compensation (i.e., goods), effort level does not depend on compensation level. ​

Kvam et al.: Our work provides a direct counterpoint to both the empirical phenomenon and this theoretical explanation for the temporal value asymmetry. First, we show systematic reversals of the temporal value asymmetry where participants sometimes preferred past outcomes. There were multiple instances where participants indicated that they preferred payoffs that could have occurred in the past to ones that could occur in the future in perfectly matched pairs – where the same dollar amount could be received in either the past or future at the same temporal distance (X days ago vs X days from now). Second, these reversals occurred as both the magnitude of and distance to the past / future payoffs were manipulated. Participants favoured past events when payoffs were small and temporal distance was large ($11, 2 years ago / from now), and favoured future events when payoffs were large or temporal distance was small ($10k, 7 days ago / from now). This may explain apparent replication failures related to the temporal value asymmetry (El Halabi et al., 2021) – not because the phenomenon is not real, but because different stimuli can cause it to reverse, and thus on average, fail to appear. Third and finally, a model comparison showed that framing the temporal value asymmetry in terms of hyperbolic (or even the more general hyperboloid) discounting is insufficient to account for the patterns of behaviour we observed.

* **Exceptionality effect.** (emotional amplification, normality bias, exceptional-routine effect). The affective response to an event is enhanced if its causes are abnormal. Exceptionality effect is the phenomenon that people associate stronger negative affect with a negative outcome when it is a result of an exception (abnormal behaviour) compared to when it is a result of routine (normal behaviour). The exceptionality enhances the response to an event for the emotion of regret, self-blame, the cognitive response for victim compensation and offender punishment.

* **Temporal differences in trait self-ascriptions**. Much like how we are more likely to ascribe dispositional traits, as opposed to situational variables, when explaining the behaviour of other people compared to ourselves, the same asymmetry can also be observed when making trait assessments about our temporally distant selves (e.g. past or future). People are more likely to ascribe dispositional traits, compared to situational explanations, when making judgements about their past or future self.

* Replication effect size: Arin et al.: Pigeons exhibited aggression towards nearby pigeons or models after being conditioned to peck a response key. This aggression was caused by the transition from food reinforcement to extinction. Various factors influenced the duration and frequency of attack. Katz and Lattal: Response increases relative to baseline during the first 20 min of a 324.75-min extinction session (Experiment 1) or during the first 30-min extinction session (Experiments 2 and 3) were rare and unsystematic. The results reinforce earlier meta-analyses concluding that extinction bursts may be a less ubiquitous early effect of extinction than has been suggested. Lerman and Iwata: Reported an initial increase in the frequency of the target response in 24% of the cases when extinction was implemented. Lerman et al.: Pattern of behaviour is consistent with what has been observed in studies of extinction bursts, where an initial increase in the targeted behaviour is often observed following the introduction of an extinction procedure.

## **Neuroscience (humans)**

* **One mind per hemisphere** (split-brain syndrome). Surgical severing of the corpus callosum leads to the split-brain phenomenon, which is characterised by 1) a response × visual field interaction, 2) strong hemispheric specialisation 3) confabulations after left-hand actions 4) split attention, and 5) the inability to compare stimuli across the midline. Together, these reported effects have been interpreted as evidence for split consciousness. Surgical procedure does not result in the development of two independent minds or consciousnesses within one brain. Instead, the findings suggest that the two hemispheres continue to work together, even in the absence of the corpus callosum.

* **Hydrocephaly.** The effect of massive volume loss improving cognition. Hydrocephalus, also known as "water on the brain," is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system of the brain. This can cause the ventricles to become enlarged, putting pressure on the brain and causing a wide range of symptoms, depending on the severity of the condition and the age of the individual. There are two types of Hydrocephalus: congenital and acquired. Congenital Hydrocephalus is present at birth and is caused by a genetic or developmental abnormality. Acquired Hydrocephalus develops later in life and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a brain tumour, infection, or injury.

Hawks: The reported cases do not apparently involve significant gray matter tissue loss. A "thin" cortex does not necessarily imply functionally small cortical volume, even with substantial white tissue loss. Neuroskeptic: While the enormous “holes” in these brains seem dramatic, the bulk of the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, around the outside of the brain, appears to be intact and in the correct place; no detailed post-mortem studies of their brain tissue have been published. Gwern: the cases turn out to be suspiciously un⁣ver⁣i⁣fi⁣able (Lor⁣ber), likely fraud⁣u⁣lent (Oliveira), or actually low in⁣tel⁣li⁣gence (Feuil⁣let). It is un⁣clear if high-functioning cases of hydrocephalus even have less brain mass, as opposed to lower proxy measures like brain vol⁣ume. Feuillet et al.: man who got to 44 years old before anyone realised his severe hydrocephaly, through marriage and employment. IQ 75 (i.e. _d_=-1.7).

* **Readiness potentials**. Readiness potentials are neural signals that are observed in the brain prior to voluntary movements. They are typically measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and are thought to reflect the neural activity associated with preparing for a movement, occurring several hundred milliseconds before the movement occurred, suggesting that the brain prepares for the movement before the person is consciously aware of the decision to move. RP have been observed in various regions of the brain, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex. [Schurger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192467/) et al. (2021) for a glossary. The discovery of readiness potentials (RP) has been used to argue against the concept of free will, as it suggests that the neural activity associated with a voluntary movement starts before the person is consciously aware of the decision to move.

* Original effect size: NA.
* Replication effect size: Fried et al.: replicated (no ES). Travers et al.: replicated (no ES). McGilchrist/ Alexander et al.: The neural activity observed may not necessarily be associated with the preparation for a voluntary movement, but rather with a cognitive process such as attention or decision making. Some studies have suggested that RP may reflect the neural activity associated with attentional processes rather than motor preparation, and that the relationship between RP and voluntary movement is not as clear-cut as initially thought.

* **Left-brain vs. Right-brain Hypothesis**. Individuals may be left-brain dominant or right-brain dominant based on personality and cognitive style. Specifically, the hypothesis proposes that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions and abilities, with the left hemisphere being associated with logical, analytical, and verbal skills, and the right hemisphere being associated with creative, intuitive, and spatial skills. This idea has been popularised in popular culture, but it is not supported by scientific evidence.

* Replication effect size:  Armony and Dolan: the presence of the aversive visual context was associated with enhanced activity in parietal cortex, which may reflect an increase in attention to the presence of environmental threat stimuli. Büchel et al.: Differential evoked responses, related to conditioning, were found in the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula, regions with known involvement in emotional processing. Büchel et al.: Differential responses (CS+ vs CS−), related to conditioning, were observed in anterior cingulate and anterior insula, regions previously implicated in delay fear conditioning; differential responses were also observed in the amygdala and hippocampus that were best characterized with a time × stimulus interaction, indicating rapid adaptation of CS+-specific responses in medial temporal lobe. Fullana et al.: no robust and consistent involvement of the amygdala in fear acquisition across studies; see effect size maps (Fig. 1, 2, 3, and 4; maps are difficult to convert into numbers). Mechias et al.: consistent activation in rostral dmPFC but not in the other candidate areas; discussing methodological constraints. Öhman et al.: excellent overview about early replications and methodological considerations to capture amygdala activity in humans.  Phelps et al.: amygdala activation was correlated across subjects with the conditioned response in both acquisition and early extinction.. Sehlmeyer et al.: A network consisting of fear-related brain areas, such as amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, is activated independently of design parameters. However, some neuroimaging studies do not report these findings in the presence of methodological heterogeneities. Furthermore, other brain areas are differentially activated, depending on specific design parameters. These include stronger hippocampal activation in trace conditioning and tactile stimulation. Furthermore, tactile unconditioned stimuli enhance activation of pain related, motor, and somatosensory areas. Sperl et al.: Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala.

* **First instinct fallacy**, the false belief that one’s initial thoughts/ideas/answers are right and closer to the truth than revised thoughts/ideas/answers.

* Replication effect size: Couchman et. al.: _d_=0.58. Students who were confident in their first answers were usually right, and those who were not confident were usually wrong. They also found that changing answers from low to high confidence improved scores, and changing from high to low confidence lowered scores. They said that metacognition, or thinking about one’s own thinking, helped students decide when to change answers, and that the first instinct fallacy depended on how confident students were in their first answers. Additionally shows that  although participants were generally better at answering questions when they were confident in their first instinct, revising answers can still lead to improved performance, especially when participants are less confident in their initial response.

Marshall and Warren: ES not reported, but the bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ identified as correlated with ulcers and were present in almost all patients with active chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric ulcer and thus may be an important factor in the aetiology of these diseases (not replicated). Gough et al.: treating ulcers with antibiotics reduced recurrence by approximately 90-95% (not replicated). Leventstein et al.: five baseline psychological measures (depression, hostility, ego resiliency, social alienation or anomy, and personal uncertainty) had significant age-adjusted associations with incident ulcer [OR= 1.8 to 2.6]. Levenstein et al.: ES not reported, but conclusion that in most ulcer cases where stress is involved, _H. pylori_ is likely to be present as well. The impact of the two factors may be additive (replicated). Levenstein et al.: ulcer incidence was significantly higher among subjects in the highest tertile of stress scores (3.5%) than the lowest tertile (1.6%) (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2–3.9; _P_ &lt; .01); Stress had similar effects on ulcers associated with _H. pylori_ infection and those unrelated to either _H. pylori_ or use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (replicated).

The reference in all analyses are white candidates. In sum, the meta analysis found no support for the hypothesis that voters discriminate against ethnic minority political candidates, and in the case of Asian candidates, even favour them over white candidates. One caveat when comparing this replication to the original is that the replication considers voters of all races, while the original specifically singles out white voters. The meta analysis on the other hand singles out minority voters in a separate analysis and finds that they prefer political candidates of the same race/ethnicity (_b_ = 0.079, _p_&lt;0.05).

* Replication effect size: Ludeke and Rasmussen: Literature review: ES not reported but general conclusion that those on the right/conservative are typically higher in Conscientiousness, behavioural constraint (as measured by by the Orderliness and Politeness aspects in the Big Five model of personality and the low pole of Eysenck's Psychoticism construct) and on moralistic bias measures such as IM and EPQ-Lie (Reversed); Big Five measures and socio-political attitudes: Openness negatively correlated with Conservative self-placement (_r_ = -.21), Authoritarianism (_r_ = -.29), and Social Dominance Orientation (_r_ = -.39), Conscientiousness positively correlated with Conservative self-placement (_r_ = .21), and Authoritarianism (_r_ = .19), Agreeableness negatively correlated with Social Dominance Orientation (_r_ = -.39) (_p_s &lt;.001); Eysenckian measures (EPQ): Psychoticism correlated negatively with Conservative ideological self-placement (_r_ = -.22) and with Authoritarianism (_r_ = -.20), but correlated positively with Social Dominance Orientation (_r_ = .11) (ps &lt;.001), The Lie scale correlated positively with Conservative ideological self-placement (_r_ = .10) and with Authoritarianism (_r_ = .17) (_p_s &lt;.001) (Reversed). Verhulst et al.:  coding error in the original manuscript, the descriptive analyses report that those higher in Eysenck’s psychoticism are more conservative, but they are actually more liberal; and where the original manuscript reports those higher in neuroticism and social desirability are more liberal, they are, in fact, more conservative (reversed).

* **Owners predict spatial impulsivity in dogs** (spatial discounting, spatial discount, distance discounting). This phenomenon explores whether owner ratings of impulsivity in their dogs correlate with behavioural measures of the distance their dogs travel in a spatial impulsivity task. The original study (Brady et al., 2018) found that owner ratings of adult dog impulsivity (using the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale; Wright et al., 2011) matched levels of impulsivity in a spatial impulsivity task (but not for young dogs). Two subsequent studies using similar methods did not replicate this correlation, and an overall meta-analysis did not find evidence for an effect.​

## **Evolutionary Linguistics**

* **Typological Prevalence Hypothesis.** The typological prevalence hypothesis is a proposal that suggests that certain structural features are more common across languages than others due to factors such as ease of learning, processing, and use. These more prevalent structural features are thought to be more likely to be retained in a language over time. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorising across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance.
