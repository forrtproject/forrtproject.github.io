I am a Research Fellow working in primary care research and implementation science at the Leeds Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds. I am a keen advocate for open research practices, which led to me joining the amazing FORRT community in 2021! Since, I have worked behind the scenes on aspects such as our communication (e.g., newsletter, social media), and community and cohesion building.
