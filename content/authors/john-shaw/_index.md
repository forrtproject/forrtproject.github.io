John J. Shaw (he/him) is a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Edge Hill University and a Chartered Psychologist with the British Psychological Society. His research sits in cognitive and developmental psychology, with one consistent theme: sleep. He studies how sleep supports learning, memory, and cognitive performance, including how sleeping soon after learning can strengthen understanding of newly taught mathematical concepts. He also works on how social media use in preadolescents relates to sleep and wellbeing, at a stage where many children are online before traditional “minimum age” guidelines. Beyond sleep, he has collaborated on work examining how autistic children understand ownership and how neurodiversity is treated within academia. Alongside his academic role, he is active in open research and reproducibility work, contributing to the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT), an international initiative focused on research transparency and accessible training for early-career researchers.
