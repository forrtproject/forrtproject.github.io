Dr Madeleine Pownall is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Leeds. Her work spans three main areas: pedagogical research on psychological literacy and student outcomes; open and transparent research practices in psychology; and feminist social psychology, particularly around gender and equity in education and research. She is interested in how psychological science can be made more inclusive, reflective, and socially responsible. Dr Pownall teaches across undergraduate and postgraduate levels, focusing on evidence-based and inclusive approaches to learning and assessment. She also contributes to projects that promote open scholarship and the integration of global citizenship within psychology curricula. Alongside her research and teaching, she serves on professional committees, mentors early career researchers, and co-authored A Feminist Companion to Social Psychology. Her work aims to support students and researchers to engage critically and ethically with psychological knowledge.
