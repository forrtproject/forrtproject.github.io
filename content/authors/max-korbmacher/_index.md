Max Korbmacher is a neuroscientist with a research focus at the intersection of basic and translational brain science. His primary work involves the analysis of large-scale neuroimaging datasets to develop and adapt machine learning models that generalize from healthy populations to individuals with neurological disorders. These models are informed by ageing research and aim to elucidate mechanisms of brain structure and clinical presentation across the lifespan. His broader research interests span neurology, psychology, and meta-science, with a particular emphasis on enhancing the transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability of empirical research. Dr. Korbmacher is actively engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations and contributes to ongoing efforts to strengthen methodological standards in neuroscience and beyond.
