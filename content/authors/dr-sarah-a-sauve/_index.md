Dr. Sarah Sauvé is currently a Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Lincoln. She is a white immigrant living and working on the land of the people who colonized the land on which she was born and spent most of her life so far. She is interested in applying feminist and critical theory and praxis to music science research, where her specialties include the neuroscience of learning, music perception in older adults, computational modeling and public engagement.
In FORRT, she has been involved in co-leading Team Citational Politics and is very excited to be part of FORRT's first steering committee as Director of Social Justice and DEIA!
