I am senior researcher and metaresearcher at the Center for Reproducible Science at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. After my PhD in Biostatistics at University of Zurich, I left academia to join the data team of the Swiss National Science Foundation as a statistician, where I worked on diverse data and statistics projects informing science policy. I returned to academia, after having developed a new passion for metaresearch - the interdisciplinary study of research itself. Now, my research interests include developing and testing new approaches for allocating research funding, statistical methods in research, and improving reproducibility and the uptake of Open Science. Also, I love teaching!
