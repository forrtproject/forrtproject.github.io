I work as a Lecturer in Organisational Psychology at Birkbeck Business School, University of London. There, I teach on organisational psychology master programmes and research how workforce diversity can be harnessed to improve organisational performance, and how we can improve the reliability of research. This includes co-leading FORRT’s Replication Hub, acting as a Senior Editor for Replication Research, and leading the UKRI-funded project Making Replications Count. In addition, I am interested in intergroup contact research, and serve as Co-Chair of the International Contact Research Network.

I am also very interested in Open Science and an avid R user. In that space, I enjoy contributing to the development of tools that support open research - for instance, the CiteSource package that supports meta-analyses. I have also authored three R packages, rsprite2, timesaveR and metaUI.
