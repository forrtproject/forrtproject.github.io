I recently joined FORRT and am beginning to support the team with operational and administrative tasks, especially in accounting and coordination. I’m excited to contribute to FORRT’s mission of fostering open and reproducible research and to learn more about the work that makes such initiatives possible. My background is in office administration and project organization, and I’m particularly interested in how clear structures and good processes can help teams work more effectively.
