Coming from an academic environment that can be highly competitive, it’s hard to even
imagine what it feels like to be part of a culture rooted in collaboration — but FORRT has
been that breath of fresh air for me.

Doing research can be incredibly demotivating and lonely. At FORRT, however, I found a
diverse community of people who understood what I was feeling — and even when they
didn’t fully understand, they listened. That changed everything for me.

Feeling heard, welcomed, and valued made me realize how much others need that too.

Every day I learn something new, whether on the technical side or the human side of
research. And although I clearly see how FORRT contributes to my professional growth, I
also genuinely feel that my own contributions to the community matter just as much. I feel
like I belong.

I can’t wait to see what’s still to come. Thank you, FORRT!
