# How to add testimonials

This testimonials lives in `content/widgets/testimonialN.md` (where `N` is the testimonial number) and its image in `testimonialN.webp` in the same folder.

## Adding a New Testimonial

   - Copy `testimonial1.md` → `testimonial2.md` (increment the number).
2. **Add your content**:
   - Create a title in the first row
   - Add the body
   - Update ORCiD and email address - or delete those sections
3. **Save your picture**:
   - Ensure that it can be shown in a circle - i.e. that the face is close to the center, with some space around
   - Convert to WebP (e.g. `https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-webp`).
   - Save in folder as `testimonial2.webp`.
   - Change name in picture reference, and add name in alt text
4. **Adjust order**:
   - In the front matter, set `weight = X` (lower = earlier).
5. **Pick a background color**
   - We’ve generated 10 harmonious options spanning the spectrum. Copy one of these into `design.background.color`.
   - Best just move down the line below from the previous testimonial
