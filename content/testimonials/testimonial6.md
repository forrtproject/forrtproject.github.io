I joined FORRT at the very beginning of my PhD, during a period shaped by COVID-19 lockdowns, when I was deeply motivated to do research well but still learning what that could look like in practice. I was searching for ways to meaningfully engage with metascience and to move beyond abstract commitments to open science toward concrete, values-driven research practices.
Participating in FORRT gave me exactly that. Through hands-on collaboration, mentorship, and shared reflection, I learned how to actively engage with open and reproducible research principles as an integrated part of my doctoral training. What began as volunteer involvement quickly became a formative space for growth — intellectually, professionally, and personally — grounded in learning with others.

Now, as a FORRT Steward, I am especially grateful for the community that has supported me at every stage of my journey. FORRT continues to shape how I think about rigor, care, and responsibility in research, and it remains a community I am excited to keep building with — not just throughout my PhD, but well beyond it.
