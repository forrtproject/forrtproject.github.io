### FORWARD: A UNESCO Decade of Science Programme
<img src="unesco_recognition.webp" width="200" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" alt="FORWARD: A UNESCO Decade of Science Programme"> 

**FORRT** is one of the few initiatives worldwide to be formally endorsed as a **Programme** of the [International Decade of Sciences for Sustainable Development (IDSSD, 2024–2033)](https://www.un-sciences-decade.org/en) , led by UNESCO and the United Nations (UN). This endorsement reflects the highest level of UN policy recognition and positions FORRT’s work in Education & Pedagogy (Curriculum Hub), Metascience & Research (Replication Hub) and Social Justice & DEIA as an **essential contribution to the UN’s strategy for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.
