__*Meta-psychology special issue*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have partnered with the journal [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology) and the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) to work on a recurring special issue. The call will request teaching materials, including pedagogical considerations, for the Educational NEXUS. This also sets the stage for our vision of academia in which the creation and maintenance of teaching resources are more valued - changing the publication’s structure to include these excellent and open resources.

__*Center for Open Science - OSKB & COSGN*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are partnering up with [OSKB](https://cos.io/oskb) ([Open Science Knowledge Base](https://cos.io/oskb)) to coordinate the alignment of our meta-data on educational materials so that we share our resources and community. To that end, FORRT will have a community in OSKB’s home ([OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)) and enrich data and reduced redundant work. FORRT also joined COS network-of-networks or [Community of Open Scholarship Grassroots Networks](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo) ([COSGN](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo)). These partnerships aim to help build a community of existing educational initiatives, strengthening our missions, and streamline the advancement of open and reproducible educational practices.
