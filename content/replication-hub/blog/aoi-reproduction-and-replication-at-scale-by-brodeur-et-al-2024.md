*[\*AoI = “Articles of Interest” is a feature of TRN where we report excerpts of recent research related to replication and research integrity.]*

**EXCERPTS (taken from the [*article*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01807-2))**

“We are thrilled to announce that we are broadening our focus to new disciplines through a collaboration with Nature Human Behaviour. As part of this collaboration, we will be reproducing and replicating as many studies as possible of those that are published in Nature Human Behaviour (from 2023 and going forward), including in the fields of anthropology, epidemiology, economics, management, politics and psychology.”

“Furthermore, we will organize multiple replication games dedicated to reproducing and replicating articles in Nature Human Behaviour. All replication enthusiasts are invited to participate and will be granted co-authorship to a meta-paper that combines all reproductions and replications. The plan is for this meta-paper to then be considered for publication as a research article in Nature Human Behaviour (subject to peer review).”

“We are enthusiastic about this collaboration with Nature Human Behaviour and are actively looking for replicators. Please contact us by email at [instituteforreplication@gmail.com](mailto:instituteforreplication@gmail.com) if you would like to join our initiative!”
