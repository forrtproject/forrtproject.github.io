**ABSTRACT (taken from *[the article](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-024-02101-x)*)**

“We [implemented] a large-scale empirical exploration of the variation in effect sizes and model predictions generated by the analytical decisions of different researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology.”

“We used two unpublished datasets, one from evolutionary ecology (blue tit, *Cyanistes caeruleus*, to compare sibling number and nestling growth) and one from conservation ecology (*Eucalyptus*, to compare grass cover and tree seedling recruitment). The project leaders recruited 174 analyst teams, comprising 246 analysts, to investigate the answers to prespecified research questions.”

“We found substantial heterogeneity among results for both datasets, although the patterns of variation differed between them. For the blue tit analyses, the average effect was convincingly negative, with less growth for nestlings living with more siblings, but there was near continuous variation in effect size from large negative effects to effects near zero, and even effects crossing the traditional threshold of statistical significance in the opposite direction.”

“In contrast, the average relationship between grass cover and *Eucalyptus* seedling number was only slightly negative and not convincingly different from zero, and most effects ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive, with about a third of effects crossing the traditional threshold of significance in one direction or the other. However, there were also several striking outliers in the *Eucalyptus* dataset, with effects far from zero.”

“…analyses with results that were far from the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those analyses that found results that were close to the mean.”

“The existence of substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.”
