*[\*AoI = “Articles of Interest” is a feature of TRN where we report abstracts of recent research related to replication and research integrity.]*

**ABSTRACT (taken from *[the article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02129-1)*)**

“Most empirical research articles feature a single primary analysis that is conducted by the authors. However, different analysis teams usually adopt different analytical approaches and frequently reach varied conclusions. We propose synchronous robustness reports [SRRs] — brief reports that summarize the results of alternative analyses by independent experts — to strengthen the credibility of science.”

“To integrate SRRs seamlessly into the publication process, we suggest the framework outlined as a flowchart in Fig. 2. As the flowchart shows, the SRRs form a natural extension to the standard review process.”
