###### Providing access to the data is a prerequisite for replication of empirical analysis. Unfortunately, this access is not always granted to everyone (see ***[here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021101)***, and ***[here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533904/)***).  There is evidence that some of this may be due to concerns about requestors’ qualifications (see ***[here](https://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ijUrAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=Fienberg+and+Martin+1985&ots=bG1rHqkTvk&sig=xxkl267n6UZbMBQc1X3o8ASc7PQ#v=onepage&q=Fienberg%20and%20Martin%201985&f=false)***).

###### In two recent papers, we investigated how willingness to share depended on the identity of the requestor. In a paper entitled, **[*“(Un)available upon request: field experiment on researchers’ willingness to share supplementary materials*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22686633)***”*,  Ernesto Reuben and I  found that only 44% of economists were willing to share supplementary research materials of a published study they had promised to send “upon request”.  This number was slightly higher if the request came from a high prestigious university rather than one that was less prestigious.

###### In “**[*Gender, beauty and support networks in academia: evidence from a field experiment*](http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/warwpaper/2015-43.htm)** (Study 1)”, Magdalena Smyk and I asked experimental economists to share data they used in their published paper. The focus in this experiment was the role of gender: half the requests were sent by a female student, the other half by a male. Overall compliance rate was 34.7%, with no gender effect.

###### The fact that requestor’s identity matters little is good news of course, as it suggests a roughly level playing field. However, while compliance rates in economics are higher than many other disciplines (see ***[here](https://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/sociologists-need-to-be-better-at-replication-a-guest-post-by-cristobal-young/#comment-140734)*** and ***[here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007078)*** and ***[here](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(13)01400-0)***), there is still much room for improvement.
