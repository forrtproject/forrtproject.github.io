###### (NOTE: This ironic blog post was originally published on ***<http://www.nicebread.de/introducing-p-hacker/>***)

##### **My Dear Fellow Scientists!**

###### *“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.”*

###### This aphorism, attributed to ***[Ronald Coase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase)***, sometimes has been used in a dis-respective manner, as if it was wrong to do creative data analysis.

###### In fact, the art of creative data analysis has experienced despicable attacks over the last years. A small but annoyingly persistent group of second-stringers tries to denigrate our scientific achievements. They drag science through the mire.

###### These people propagate stupid method repetitions (also know as “direct replications”); and what was once one of the supreme disciplines of scientific investigation – a creative data analysis of a data set – has been crippled to conducting an empty-headed step-by-step pre-registered analysis plan. (Come on: If I lay out the full analysis plan in a pre-registration, even an *undergrad* student can do the final analysis, right? Is that really the high-level scientific work we were trained for so hard?).

###### They broadcast in an annoying frequency that *p*-hacking leads to more significant results, and that researchers who use *p*-hacking have higher chances of getting things published.

###### What are the consequence of these findings? The answer is clear. Everybody should be equipped with these powerful tools of research enhancement!

##### **The Art of Creative Data Analysis**

###### Some researchers describe a performance-oriented data analysis as “data-dependent analysis”. We go one step further, and call this technique ***data-optimal analysis (***[***DOA***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DOA)***)***, as our goal is to produce the optimal, most significant outcome from a data set.

###### I developed an **online app that allows to practice creative data analysis and how to polish your *p*-values**. It’s primarily aimed at young researchers who do not have our level of expertise yet, but I guess even old hands might learn one or two new tricks! It’s called “The p-hacker” (please note that ‘hacker’ is meant in a very positive way here. You should think of the cool hackers who fight for world peace). You can use the app in teaching, or to practice *p*-hacking yourself.

###### Please test the app, and give me feedback! You can also send it to colleagues: ***<http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-hacker>***

###### The full R code for this Shiny app is on ***[Github](https://github.com/nicebread/p-hacker)***.

##### **Train Your *p*-Hacking Skills: Introducing the *p*-Hacker App**

###### Here’s a quick walk-through of the app. Please see also the quick manual at the top of the app for more details.

###### First, you have to run an initial study in the “New study” tab:

###### pic1

###### When you ran your first study, inspect the results in the middle pane. Let’s take a look at our results, which are quite promising:

###### pic2

###### **After exclusion of this obvious outlier, your first study is already a success!** Click on “Save” next to your significant result to save the study to your study stack on the right panel:

###### pic3

###### Sometimes outlier exclusion is not enough to improve your result.

###### Now comes the magic. Click on the “Now: p-hack!” tab – **this gives you all the great tools to improve your current study**. Here you can fully utilize your data analytic skills and creativity.

###### In the following example, we could not get a significant result by outlier exclusion alone. But after adding 10 participants (in two batches of 5), controlling for age and gender, and focusing on the variable that worked best – voilà!

###### Do you see how easy it is to craft a significant study?

###### Now it is important to **show even more productivity**: Go for the next conceptual replication (i.e., go back to Step 1 and collect a new sample, with a new manipulation and a new DV). Whenever your study reached significance, click on the *Save* button next to each DV and the study is saved to your stack, awaiting some additional conceptual replications that show the robustness of the effect.

###### **Many journals require multiple studies**. Four to six studies should make a compelling case for your subtile, counterintuitive, and shocking effects:

###### Honor to whom honor is due: Find the best outlet for your achievements!

###### My friends, let’s stand together and Make Science Great Again! I really hope that the *p*-hacker app can play its part in bringing science back to its old days of glory.

###### (A quick side note: Some so-called „data-detectives“ developed several methods for detecting *p*-hacking. This is a cowardly attack on creative data analyses. If you want to take a look at these detection tools,  check out the ***[p-checker app](http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/)***. You can also transfer your *p*-hacked results to the p-checker app with a single click on the button ‘Send to p-checker’ below your study stack on the right side).

###### Best regards,
