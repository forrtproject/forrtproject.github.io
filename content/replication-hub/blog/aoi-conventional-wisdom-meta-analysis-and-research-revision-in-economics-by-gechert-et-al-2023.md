**EXCERPT (taken from the [article](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/280745/1/Meta-analysis-review.pdf))**

“The purpose of this study is to compare the findings of influential meta-analyses to the ‘conventional wisdom’ about the same economic question or issue. What have we learned from meta-analyses of economics? How do their results differ from the conventional, textbook understanding of economics?”

“We identify ‘influential’ meta-analyses as those with at least 100 citations that were published in 2000 or later, and those that were recommended by a survey of members of the Meta-Analysis of Economics Research Network (MAER-Net)”

“Out of the full sample of 360 studies, 72 studies cover a general interest topic in economics and include original empirical estimates for a certain effect size. We narrow down further to those meta-analyses that provide both a simple mean of the original effect size and a corrected mean, controlling for publication bias or other biases. This gives us a final list of 24 studies covering the fields of growth and development, finance, public finance, education, international, labor, behavioral, gender, environmental, and regional/urban economics.”

“We compare the central findings of the meta-analyses to ‘conventional wisdom’ as classified by: (1) a widely recognized seminal paper or authoritative literature review; (2) the assessment of an artificial intelligence (AI), the GPT-4 Large Language Model (LLM); and (3) the simple unweighted average of reported effects included in the metaanalysis.”

“For 17 of these 24 studies, the corrected effect size is substantially closer to zero than commonly thought, or even switches sign. Statistically significant publication bias is prevalent in 17 of the 24 studies. Overall, we find that 16 of 24 studies show both a clear reduction in effect size and a statistically significant publication bias. Comparing the best estimate from the meta-analysis with the conventional wisdom from the reference study, the GPT-4 estimate, or the simple unweighted average, the relative reduction in the effect size is in the range of 45-60% in all three comparison cases.”
