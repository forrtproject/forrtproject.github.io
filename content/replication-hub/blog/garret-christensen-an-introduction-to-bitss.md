###### The Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences ([BITSS](http://www.bitss.org/)) was formed in late 2012 after a [meeting](http://www.bitss.org/annual-meeting/2012-2/) in Berkeley that led to the publication of an [article in *Science*](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6166/30.long) on ways to increase transparency and improve reproducibility in research across the social sciences. BITSS is part of Berkeley’s Center for Effective Global Action ([CEGA](http://cega.berkeley.edu/)), and is led by development economist [Edward Miguel](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/) and advised by a group of [leaders in transparent research](http://www.bitss.org/about/leadership/) from economics, psychology, political science, and public health.

###### Since our founding, we’ve worked to build a network of like-minded researchers, and focused on the following aspects of research transparency, which hopefully covers the entire lifecycle of a research project:

###### – Registering Studies: Whether it is [clinicialtrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/), the [AEA’s registry](http://www.socialscienceregistry.org/), [EGAP’s registry](http://www.egap.org/design-registration/), or [3ie’s registry](http://ridie.3ieimpact.org/), creating a database of the universe of studies helps combat publication bias.

###### – Writing Pre-Analysis Plans: Tying your hands a bit by pre-specifying the analysis you plan to run can reduce your ability to consciously or unconsciously mine the data for spurious results.

###### – Replication and Meta-Analysis: We encourage researchers to conduct and publish replications and meta-analyses so we can build on existing work more systematically.

###### – Reproducible Workflow: Organizing your research in a way that others (or just your future self) will be able to understand your code and re-run it to get the same results.

###### – Sharing Data and Code: Put data, code, and adequate documentation in a trusted public repository so that others can more easily build off your work.

###### To help spread the methods of more transparent and reproducible research, we’ve engaged in the following activities:

###### – Manual of Best Practices: a how-to guide and [reference manual](https://github.com/garretchristensen/BestPracticesManual) for researchers interested in conducting reproducible research.

###### – Semester-Long Research Transparency Course: taught by Edward Miguel as Econ 270D, the course is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XXv-cvA_iBN9JZND3CF91aouSHH9ksB) and we are working to make an interactive MOOC.

###### – Summer Institute and Workshops: an annual [training for graduate students](http://www.bitss.org/training/training-2015/) and young researchers held each June in Berkeley, featuring lectures from eminent scholars in transparency plus hands-on training in dynamic documents, version control, and data sharing.

###### – Annual Meeting and Conference Sessions: we host a conference in Berkeley with an open call for papers ([coming up December 10 and 11!](http://www.bitss.org/2015-bitss-annual-meeting/)) and have also organized sessions at past AEA/ASSA meetings and other conferences. This year we’re co-hosting a workshop on replication and transparency in San Francisco January 6-7, right after the AEA meeting. [Registration is open now!](http://ineteconomics.org/community/events/replication-and-transparency-in-economic-research)

###### – Grants: We had a call for our Social Science Meta-Analysis and Research Transparency ([SSMART](http://www.bitss.org/ssmart/)) grants. Announcements of winners will be made soon, and we plan to have an additional call next year.

###### – Prizes: We will soon be announcing the first winners of the [Leamer-Rosenthal Prizes for Open Social Science](http://www.bitss.org/prizes/leamer-rosenthal-prizes/)—young researchers who have been incorporating transparency in their work as well as established faculty who have been teaching transparency.

###### If you’re interested in getting involved, we’d love to hear from you. (You can e-mail me: [garret@berkeley.edu](mailto:garret@berkeley.edu), or our Program Director Jen Sturdy [jennifer.sturdy@berkeley.edu](mailto:jennifer.sturdy@berkeley.edu).) We’re working on formalizing a Catalyst program where you could be an ambassador for transparency at your own university or institution and receive BITSS funding for workshops and trainings. Follow us on [our blog](http://www.bitss.org/) or on [Twitter (@UCBITSS)](http://www.twitter.com/UCBITSS) to hear the latest updates.
