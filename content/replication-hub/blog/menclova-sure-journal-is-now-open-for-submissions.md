###### Is the topic of your paper interesting, your data appropriate and your analysis carefully done – but your results are not “sexy”? If so, please consider submitting your paper to the Series of Unsurprising Results in Economics. SURE is an e-journal of high-quality research with “unsurprising”/confirmatory findings.

###### This is how it works:

###### – We accept papers from all fields of Economics…

###### – Which have been rejected at a journal indexed in EconLit…

###### – With the ONLY important reason being that their results are statistically insignificant or otherwise “unsurprising”.

###### SURE is an open-access journal and there are no submission charges.

###### SURE benefits readers by:

###### – Mitigating the publication bias and thus complementing other journals in an effort to provide a complete account of the state of affairs;

###### – Serving as a repository of potential (and tentative) “dead ends” in Economics research.

###### SURE benefits writers by:

###### – Providing an outlet for interesting, high-quality, but “risky” (in terms of uncertain results) research projects;

###### – Decreasing incentives to data-mine, change theories and hypotheses ex post or exclusively focus on provocative topics.

###### We hope you will consider SURE as an outlet for your work and look forward to hearing from you!
