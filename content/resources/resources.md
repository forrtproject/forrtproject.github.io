There are more than 1000 curated resources in our database. These resources were crowdsourced by our community and, more recently, our database was increased by over 60% thanks to the [Open Science Knowledge Base](https://www.cos.io/communities/stem-education-hub)([see also link to the OER commons page](https://oercommons.org/hubs/OSKB)), a Center for Open Science educational initiative, which graciously chose FORRT to host their curated Open Science resources. COS, OSKB, and FORRT forged a partnership to promote open and reproducible research practices, enabling the scientific community to build upon each other's work and advance knowledge collaboratively. Learn more about it FORRT's and OSKB'sÂ partnership [in the COS's announcement](https://www.cos.io/blog/forrt-and-cos-join-forces-to-foster-open-and-reproducible-research-training).
