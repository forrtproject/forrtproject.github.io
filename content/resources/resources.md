There are almost 900 resources submitted so far in our database . If you notice there is an educational resource, research article or pedagogical tool missing in our database, please consider adding it [below in our on submission form](/resources/#form) or directly into [a separate g-forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPceN5opEeauCBSvapoB-ADpH0IoT24XOLfQGaVEF0EJGFOA/viewform). 

These resources were crowdsourced by our community and, more recently, our database was increased by over 60% thanks to the [Open Science Knowledge Base](https://www.cos.io/communities/stem-education-hub), a Center for Open Science educational initiative, which graciously chose FORRT to host their curated Open Science resources. COS, OSKB, and FORRT forged a partnership to promote open and reproducible research practices, enabling the scientific community to build upon each other's work and advance knowledge collaboratively. Learn more about it FORRT's and OSKB's partnership [in the COS's announcement](https://www.cos.io/blog/forrt-and-cos-join-forces-to-foster-open-and-reproducible-research-training).
