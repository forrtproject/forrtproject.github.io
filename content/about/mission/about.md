# Mission Statement

<br>

> *FORRT brings the open scholarship and reproducible science movements to teaching and mentoring, in the pursuit for the best conceivable practices in higher education. Our aspiration is to build, together with educators, a pathway towards the incremental adoption of open and reproducible science tenets in education. We believe the integration of these tenets should not be seen as an additional layer to existing proposals for reform but rather one that can unite them.*

<br>

## FORRT’s Goals include: 

* Create and maintain a space for educators to provide and receive support around best practices in teaching and mentorship
* Support scholars in their efforts to stay up-to-date on best practices regarding open and reproducible research
* Advocate for greater support and institutional recognition of the value in teaching and mentoring
* Facilitating conversations about the ethics and social impact of teaching substantive topics with due regard to scientific openness, epistemic uncertainty and the credibility revolution.  
* Foster social justice through the democratization of scientific educational resources and pedagogies.

<br>
<br>


## FORRT’s Advocacy include:

* The elevation and legitimization of educators’ roles throughout institutions and professional organizations; 
* Dismantling hierarchies surrounding research, teaching, and service; 
* Building community among educators and various non-academic communities working to improve scientific communication and literacy across academia and the general public;
* Building capacity for advocacy; and 
* Advocacy for the creation and maintenance of educational resources. 

Instead of encouraging an atmosphere of competition, we are compiling best practices in teaching open science, scientific literacy, and related topics, while advocating for structural change to foster a collaborative and conducive environment. FORRT supports endeavors to seriously examine current practices in higher education around the perceived relative importance of different academic activities and elevating teaching-related activities within those hierarchies.
