We endorses the [Mozilla Manifesto ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) in committing to verifiable facts, critical thinking, and reasoned argument along with inclusion, collaboration, and shared knowledge.  When advocating that “a person’s demographic characteristics should not determine their online access, opportunities, or quality of experience,” FORRT community concurrently advocates for civil discourse guided by human dignity. We are committed to a community that (a) includes all the peoples of the earth, where a person’s demographic characteristics do not determine their online access, opportunities, or quality of experience; (b) promotes civil discourse, human dignity, and individual expression; (c) elevates critical thinking, reasoned argument, shared knowledge, and verifiable facts; and that (d) catalyzes collaboration among diverse communities working together for the common good towards better educational practices in higher education. We are comprised of 650 people (see our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/forrt/shared_invite/zt-alobr3z7-NOR0mTBfD1vKXn9qlOKqaQ), as per 2022-12), and below you find the profiles of a few of us.
