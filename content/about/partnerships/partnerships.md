<img src="liberate-science.webp" align="right" /> Many things about research can be improved, but too often we get stuck in preventing negative things from happening. [Liberate Science](https://libscie.org/) (est. 2019) is about growing positive alternatives to enable a better research environment. This is both for the research itself and the researcher, no matter the topic or where the researcher may be. Liberate Science's main project is [ResearchEquals](https://researchequals.com/?referrer=forrt), a modular publishing platform. This helps researchers document, communicate, and get credit for each step of the research process, not only the final report.

<img src="reproducibilitea.webp" align="left" /> [The ReproducibiliTea (UKRN)](https://reproducibilitea.org/) is an ECR-led grassroots initiative that helps researchers create local Open Science journal clubs at their universities. Local journal clubs help build community for those interested in discussing diverse issues around open and reproducible research, improving research quality, research integrity, and more. Local members take ownership of how their journal club runs; whether they focus on reading and discussing papers (e.g. [using RTea's reading lists](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/)), or holding workshops and tutorials, and even hosting guest speakers. Started in early 2018 at the University of Oxford, ReproducibiliTea has now spread to over 100 institutions in 25 different countries. ReproducibiliTea is completely volunteer run, and seeks to provide a unique and supportive community for members, who are predominantly Early Career Researchers.

<img src="ProjectTier.webp" align="right" /> [Project TIER](https://www.projecttier.org) promotes the integration of principles of transparency and reproducibility in the quantitative methods training of undergraduate and graduate students. Project TIER is guided by the vision that students should be taught to use reproducible methods whenever they work with statistical data.  Reproducibility should be integrated into introductory courses in statistics or data analysis, reinforced at all levels of the quantitative methods curriculum, and ultimately adopted by students when they conduct research for theses, dissertations, or other independent projects. To pursue this vision, Project TIER's strategy is to focus on supporting instructors who wish to incorporate transparency and reproducibility in their teaching and research supervision. The primary activities include developing standards and curriculum for reproducible research, and then disseminating those resources to instructors via the TIER website, conferences and symposia, and faculty development workshops.

<img src="ReplicationWiki.webp" align="right" /> [The ReplicationWiki ](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) serves as a database of empirical studies in the social sciences. It informs about the availability of replication material for them and categorizes them by keywords, methods used, sources, type and geographic origin of data used, and by software used. It lists replication studies and their types and results as well as corrections and retractions. More than 4,600 studies are already listed as well as over 700 replications. The database helps social scientists to see which results have already been tested independently and how replications are published. For instructors it helps to easily identify practical examples, e.g., that for which a method was used that they want to teach and for which data and code are available in a software they can use with their students.

<img src="ABRIR.webp" align="left" /> [ABRIR](http://www.abrirpsy.org) (Advancing Big-team Reproducible science through Increased Representation) was established as a response to the global need of increasing representation in how we conduct open and big-team science, and as a necessity to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in psychological science. It was ‘born’ during the PSACON2021, when five psychological researchers from different parts of the world (Asia, East Europe and Latin America) gathered and discussed the position of researchers from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). They concluded that researchers from LMIC face unique challenges when fulfilling participatory or leadership roles in big-team and open science networks. Likewise, large psychology consortia struggle to recruit participants and researcher leadership beyond WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialist, Rich & Democratic) populations.

__*Meta-psychology special issue*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have partnered with the journal [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology) and the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) to work on a recurring special issue. The call will request teaching materials, including pedagogical considerations, for the Educational NEXUS. This also sets the stage for our vision of academia in which the creation and maintenance of teaching resources are more valued - changing the publication’s structure to include these excellent and open resources.

__*Center for Open Science - OSKB & COSGN*__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are partnering up with [OSKB](https://cos.io/oskb) ([Open Science Knowledge Base](https://cos.io/oskb)) to coordinate the alignment of our meta-data on educational materials so that we share our resources and community. To that end, FORRT will have a community in OSKB’s home ([OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)) and enrich data and reduced redundant work. FORRT also joined COS network-of-networks or [Community of Open Scholarship Grassroots Networks](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo) ([COSGN](https://groups.google.com/a/cos.io/forum/#!topic/network-of-open-science-grassroots-networks/1OWtx9VDSwo)). These partnerships aim to help build a community of existing educational initiatives, strengthening our missions, and streamline the advancement of open and reproducible educational practices.
