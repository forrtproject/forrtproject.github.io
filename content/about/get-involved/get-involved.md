* [FORRT's Team Neurodiversity](/neurodiversity) are working on a number of manuscripts, educational resources and public outreach materials. Topics include how open scholarship and neurodiversity can benefit each other; how participatory research links to open scholarship; tools and materials to improve inclusion of neurodivergent people in academia; and critical work around academic structures. They welcome both neurodivergent individuals and neurotypical allies, but particularly welcome individuals whose identities are underrepresented in the neurodiversity movement (including but not limited to Tourette's, speech and language differences, and acquired neurodivergence). You are welcome to join Team Neurodiversity to contribute to projects, to access the supportive spaces they are creating, or both. Please share questions or comments in [Team Neurodiversity's Slack channel](https://forrt.slack.com/archives/C02KYC2ANE4).

* We are always looking for structural support to help us manage our social media, develop our website, and other important work which keeps FORRT moving! If you are interested, please [join the FORRT Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/forrt/shared_invite/zt-alobr3z7-NOR0mTBfD1vKXn9qlOKqaQ) and introduce yourself.
