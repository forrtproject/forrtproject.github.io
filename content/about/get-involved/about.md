If you are looking to a deep dive into FORRT, there are two main ways to learn about us. If you are interested in learning about what we do, check out our [**Publications page**](/publications). If you want to learn about the intricacies of the FORRT organization, beyond what you can learn from the several pages in our *About FORRT* pages, and before [joining our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/forrt/shared_invite/zt-alobr3z7-NOR0mTBfD1vKXn9qlOKqaQ), we prepared a document for you: [**Getting Started with FORRT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ECRs6J8spO3CU6siheGL8weQ-TzdyAUpXIiIE8cUeI). It is organized in terms of involvement with the FORRT organization. 

* In part (1), we briefly describe general information about FORRT, its Slack channels and community, and provide links to resources; 
* In part (2), we describe in more detail the current initiatives at FORRT, which would benefit from your help and contribution (with authorship opportunities but no required involvement with the organization per se;
* In part (3), we describe the FORRTâ€™s organization, structure, and how to take part in it.

Check it out!
