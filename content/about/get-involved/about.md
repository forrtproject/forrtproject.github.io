If you want to learn about the intricacies of the FORRT organization, beyond what you can learn from the several pages in our *About FORRT* pages, amd before [joining our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/forrt/shared_invite/zt-alobr3z7-NOR0mTBfD1vKXn9qlOKqaQ), we prepared a document for you: [**Getting Started with FORRT**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ECRs6J8spO3CU6siheGL8weQ-TzdyAUpXIiIE8cUeI). It is organized in terms of involvement with the FORRT organization.

* In part (2), we describe in more detail the current initiatives at FORRT, which would benefit from your help and contribution (with authorship opportunities but no required involvement with the organization per se;
* In part (3), we describe the FORRT’s organization, structure, and how to take part in it.
