This project was initiated at the [2018 meeting](https://osf.io/xa4gb/) of the [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/) in the [“Teaching replicable and reproducible science”](https://osf.io/x7d45/) hackathon led by Kristen Lane and Heather Urry. The initial framework was developed in a subsequent working group consisting of: Flávio Azevedo, Sam Parsons, Carl Michael Galang, Kristin Lane, Lisa DeBruine, Benjamin Le, Donald Tellinghuisen, and Madeline Harms (we apologise if we have missed anybody - please let us know). If you are interested in learning about how FORRT developed and matured, [our first website is still online](https://forrt.netlify.app/). Fun fact, FORRT was 'born' in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Sunday, June 24th, 2018, at approximately 4pm local time.
