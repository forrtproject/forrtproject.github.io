Teams serve three key purposes: (a) advancing the adoption of open and reproducible science tenets in higher-education via the training of educators in their capacity as teachers and mentors; (b) increase of community engagement within our internal and external communities and resource gathering; (c) and providing community members with hands-on experiences of the challenges and rewards of peer-to-peer collaboration in the context of busy professional lives. Below you find the team organized alphabetically as it is the same order as in Slack.
