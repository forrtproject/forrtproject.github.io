## The what, how, and why of Open Science in the Developing World
---------------------

**Open Science in the Developing World** is a completed, large-scale international collaboration by 49 open scientists from 12 developing countries, led and supported by FORRT members, that culminated in several community resources (see below) and a peer-reviewed publication in the journal *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science* (AMPPS), entitled ["Open Science in the Developing World: A Collection of Practical Guides for Researchers in Developing Countries."](https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459251357565) See our postprint [here](http://osf.io/7ubk2).

The project responds to a central tension in the open science movement:

> while open science is often presented as *universally beneficial*, its dominant tools, incentives, and norms have largely been designed by and for researchers in well-resourced, Global North contexts.

This **Open Science in the Developing World** initiative reframes open science as something that must be **context-sensitive, adaptable, and equity-oriented**, particularly for researchers working in developing countries and other resource-constrained environments.

### What does the paper do?

---

Rather than offering abstract principles, the paper delivers a **practical, action-oriented roadmap** for engaging with open science under real-world constraints.

It explicitly acknowledges structural barriers such as:
- limited funding and infrastructure  
- language and access asymmetries  
- metric-driven academic incentives  
- unequal visibility and leadership opportunities  

and responds with **concrete strategies that researchers can adopt immediately**, without requiring institutional privilege or substantial financial resources.

### The Four-Level Engagement Framework

---

The paper introduces a **four-level guide** for engaging with open science at one’s own pace:

#### 1. **Foundation**
Using free and open resources to support rigorous research practices  
(e.g., OSF, GitHub, Zenodo, preprints, open educational materials).

#### 2. **Growth**
Adopting low-cost, high-impact practices such as:
- open data and materials (where appropriate)
- preregistration and registered reports
- free and open-source software (e.g., R, JASP, Jamovi)

#### 3. **Community**
Contributing to open science through:
- translations
- data collection in underrepresented contexts
- peer review, mentoring, and training
- participation in grassroots networks

#### 4. **Leadership**
Building and leading **local or regional open-science communities**, shaping norms, incentives, and research culture from within.

This structure explicitly rejects a “one-size-fits-all” model of open science and emphasizes **agency, sustainability, and local relevance**.


### Educational & Practical Resources

---

Beyond the main article, the project provides an extensive set of **open, reusable resources**, including:

- curated lists of **open-access repositories in developing countries**
- guidance on **ethical reuse of open data, code, and materials**
- inventories of **free and open-source software and hardware**
- open training materials for statistics, methods, and meta-research
- step-by-step guidance for contributing to and leading open-science initiatives

These materials are designed for:
- early-career researchers  
- educators and trainers  
- community organizers  
- researchers operating outside elite institutional ecosystems  

They align closely with FORRT’s broader mission to **democratize access to research training and epistemic participation**.


### Why this matters for FORRT

---

This project exemplifies several core FORRT principles:

- **Equity before compliance**: open science should reduce, not reproduce, inequality  
- **Training as infrastructure**: education and mentorship are foundational to reform  
- **Community over extraction**: meaningful inclusion requires leadership, not tokenism  
- **Pluralism in practice**: open science must adapt to diverse epistemic and material contexts  

The paper also directly informs FORRT’s ongoing work on:
- global open-science education
- citational justice
- inclusive big-team science
- community-led governance models
