    "title": "Social integration ",
    "definition": "A multi-dimensional construct, in which social integration is related to the quantity and quality of the social interactions with staff and students, as well as the sense of connection and belonging to the university and the people within the institute. To be more specific, social support, trust, and connectedness are all variables that contribute to social integration.  Social integration is a factor for mental well-being in which people who receive social support are more likely to have improved levels of control (Evans & Rubin, 2021). Hence, the implications of social integration can affect academic outcomes and mental wellbeing. The individual is  middle-class in nature (Rubin et al., 2019) and the working class are less likely to integrate with other students, since they have differing social and economic backgrounds and less disposable income. Thus they are not able to experience as many educational and fiscal opportunities than others. In turn, this leads to poor mental health and feelings of ostracism (Rubin, 2021).",
