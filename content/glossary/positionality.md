    "definition": "The contextualization of both the research environment and the researcher, to define the boundaries within the research was produced (Jaraf, 2018, p. 323-324). Positionality is typically centred and celebrated in qualitative research, but there have been recents calls for it to also be used in quantitative research as well. Positionality statements, whereby a researcher outlines their background and ‘position’ within and towards the research, have been suggested as one method of recognising and centring researcher bias.",
