    "title": "External Validity",
    "definition": "Whether the findings of a scientific study can be generalized to other contexts outside the study context (different measures, people, places, and times). Statistically, threats to external validity reflect interactions whereby the effect of one factor (the independent variable) depends on another factor (a confounding variable). External validity may also be limited by the study design (e.g., an artificial laboratory setting or a non-representative sample).",
