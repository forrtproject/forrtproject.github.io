  "definition": "Beliefs held by researchers about the parameters in a statistical model before further evidence is taken into account. A ‘prior’ is expressed as a probability distribution and can be determined in a number of ways (e.g., previous research, subjective assessment, principles such as maximising entropy given constraints), and is typically combined with the likelihood function using Bayes’ theorem to obtain a posterior distribution.",
