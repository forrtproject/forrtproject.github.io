  "title": "Equity",
  "definition": "Different individuals have different starting positions (cf. “opportunity gaps”) and needs. Whereas equal treatment focuses on treating all individuals equally, equitable treatment aims to level the playing field by actively increasing opportunities for under-represented minorities. Equitable treatment aims to attain equality through “fairness”: taking into account different needs for support for different individuals, instead of focusing merely on the needs of the majority.",
