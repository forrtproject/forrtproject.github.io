  "title": "BIZARRE",
  "definition": "This acronym refers to Barren, Institutional, Zoo, and other Rare Rearing Environments (BIZARRE). Most research for chimpanzees is conducted on this specific sample. This limits the generalizability of a large number of research findings in the chimpanzee population. The BIZARRE has been argued to reflect the universal concept of what is a chimpanzee (see also WEIRD, which has been argued to be a universal concept for what is a human).",
