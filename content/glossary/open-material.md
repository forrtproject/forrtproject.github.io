    "definition": "Author’s public sharing of materials that were used in a study, “such as survey items, stimulus materials, and experiment programs” (Kidwell et al., 2016, p. 3). Digitally-shareable materials are posted on open access repositories, which makes them publicly available and accessible. Depending on licensing, the material can be reused by other authors for their own studies. Components that are not digitally-shareable (e.g. biological materials, equipment) must be described in sufficient detail to allow reproducibility.",
