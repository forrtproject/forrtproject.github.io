    "definition": "The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) describes a simple and easy-to-adopt way of organizing neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and behavioral data (i.e., file formats, folder structures). BIDS is a community effort developed by the community for the community and was inspired by the format used internally by the OpenfMRI repository known as OpenNeuro. Having initially been developed for fMRI data, the BIDS data structure has been extended for many other measures, such as EEG (Pernet et al., 2019).",
