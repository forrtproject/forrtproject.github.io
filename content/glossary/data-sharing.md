    "title": "Data sharing",
    "definition": "collection of practices, technologies, cultural elements and legal frameworks that are relevant to the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Gollwitzer et al. (2020) describe two types of data sharing: Type 1: Data that is necessary to reproduce the findings of a published research article. Type 2: data that have been collected in a research project but have not (or only partly) been analysed or reported after the completion of the project and are hence typically shared under a specified embargo period.",
