  "title": "Reflexivity",
  "definition": "The process of reflexivity refers to critically considering the knowledge that we produce through research, how it is produced, and our own role as researchers in producing this knowledge. There are different forms of reflexivity; personal reflexivity whereby researchers consider the impact of their own personal experiences, and functional whereby researchers consider the way in which our research tools and methods may have impacted knowledge production. Reflexivity aims to bring attention to underlying factors which may impact the research process, including development of research questions, data collection, and the analysis.",
