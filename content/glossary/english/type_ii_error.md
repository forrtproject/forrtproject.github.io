    "definition": "A false negative result occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true in the population but the null hypothesis is accepted as part of the analysis (Hartgerink et al., 2017). That is, finding a non-significant statistical result when the effect is true  (For example, a judge passing an innocent verdict on a guilty person). False negatives are less likely to be the subject of replications than positive results (Fiedler et al., 2012), and remain an unresolved issue in scientific research (Hartgerink et al., 2017).",
