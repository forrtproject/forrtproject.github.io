    "definition": "Definition : JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data format for structured data that can be used to represent attribute-value pairs. Values thereby can contain further JSON notation (i.e., nested information). JSON files can be formally encoded as strings of text and thus are human-readable. Beyond storing information this feature makes them suitable for annotating other content. For example, JSON files are used in Brain Imaging Data Structure ( BIDS )  for describing the metadata dataset by following a standardized format (dataset_description.json).",
