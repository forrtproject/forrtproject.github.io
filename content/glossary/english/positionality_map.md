    "definition": "A reflexive tool for practicing explicit positionality in critical qualitative research. The map is to be used “as a flexible starting point to guide researchers to reflect and be reflexive about their social location. The map involves three tiers: the identification of social identities (Tier 1), how these positions impact our life (Tier 2), and details that may be tied to the particularities of our social identity (Tier 3).” (Jacobson and Mustafa 2019, p. 1). The aim of the map is “for researchers to be able to better identify and understand their social locations and how they may pose challenges and aspects of ease within the qualitative research process.”",
