  "title": "Face validity",
  "definition": "A subjective judgement of how suitable a measure appears to be on the surface, that is, how well a measure is operationalized. For example, judging whether questionnaire items should relate to a construct of interest at face value. Face validity is related to construct validity, but since it is subjective/informal, it is considered an easy but weak form of validity.",
