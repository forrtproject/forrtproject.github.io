    "definition": "With a particular focus on gender and sexuality, feminist psychology is inherently concerned with representation, diversity, inclusion, accessibility, and equality. Feminist psychology initially grew out out of a concern for representing the lived experiences of girls and women, but has since evolved into a more nuanced, intersectional and comprehensive concern for all aspects of equality (e.g., Eagly & Riger, 2014). Feminist psychologists have advocated for more rigorous consideration of equality, diversity, and inclusion within Open Science spaces (Pownall et al., 2021).",
