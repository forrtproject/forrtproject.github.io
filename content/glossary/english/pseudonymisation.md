    "definition": "Pseudonymisation refers to a technique that involves replacing or removing any information that could lead to identification of research subjectsâ€™ identity whilst still being able to make them identifiable through the use of the combination of code number and identifiers. This process comprises the following steps: removal of all identifiers from the research dataset; attribution of a specific identifier (pseudonym) for each participant and using it to label each research record; and maintenance of a cipher that links the code number to the participant in a document physically separate from the dataset. Pseudonymisation is typically a minimum requirement from ethical committees when conducting research, especially on human participants or involving confidential information, in order to ensure upholding of data privacy.",
