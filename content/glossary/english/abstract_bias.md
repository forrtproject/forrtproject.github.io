    "definition": "The tendency to report only significant results in the abstract, while reporting non-significant results within the main body of the manuscript (not reporting non-significant results altogether would constitute selective reporting). The consequence of abstract bias is that studies reporting non-significant results may not be captured with standard meta-analytic search procedures (which rely on information in the title, abstract and keywords) and thus biasing the results of meta-analyses.",
