    "definition": "R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment that can be used to conduct statistical analyses and plot data. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland. R enables authors to share reproducible analysis scripts, which increases the transparency of a study. Often, R is used in conjunction with an integrated development environment (IDE) which simplifies working with the language, for example RStudio or Visual Studio Code, or Tinn-R .",
