    "definition": "A software package for tracking changes in a local set of files (local version control), initially developed by Linus Torvalds. In general, it is used by programmers to track and develop computer source code within a set directory, folder or a file system. Git can access remote repository hosting services (e.g. GitHub) for remote version control that enables collaborative software development by uploading contributions from a local system. This process found its way into the scientific process to enable open data, open code and reproducible analyses.",
