    "definition": "Active research collaboration with the population of interest, as opposed to conducting research “about” them. Researchers can incorporate the lived experience and expertise of patients and the public at all stages of the research process. For example, patients can help to develop a set of research questions, review the suitability of a study design, approve plain English summaries for grant/ethics applications and dissemination, collect and analyse data, and assist with writing up a project for publication. This is becoming highly recommended and even required by fu nders (Boivin et al., 2018).",
