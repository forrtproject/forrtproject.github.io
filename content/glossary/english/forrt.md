    "definition": "Framework of Open Reproducible Research and Teaching. It aims to provide a pedagogical infrastructure designed to recognize and support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible research in tandem with prototypical subject matters in higher education. FORRT strives to be an effective, evolving, and community-driven organization raising awareness of the pedagogical implications of open and reproducible science and its associated challenges (i.e., curricular reform, epistemological uncertainty, methods of education). FORRT also advocates for the opening of teaching and mentoring materials as a means to facilitate access, discovery, and learning to those who otherwise would be educationally disenfranchised.",
