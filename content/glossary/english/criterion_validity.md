    "definition": "The degree to which a measure corresponds to other valid measures of the same concept. Criterion validity is usually established by calculating regression coefficients or bivariate correlations estimating the direction and strength of relation between test measure and criterion measure. It is often confused with *construct validity* although it differs from it in intent (merely predictive rather than theoretical) and interest (predicting an observable outcome rather than a latent construct). Unreliability in either test or criterion scores usually diminishes criterion validity. Also called criterion-related or concrete validity.",
