    "definition": "Analytical approaches and models assume certain characteristics of oneâ€™s data (e.g., statistical independence, random samples, normality, equal variance,...). Before running an analysis, thes e assumptions should be checked since their violation can change the results and conclusion of a study. Good practice in open and reproducible science is to report ass umption testing in terms of the assumptions verified and the results of such checks or corrections applied.",
