    "definition": "The Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) is a high-level taxonomy used to indicate the roles typically adopted by contributors to scientific scholarly output. There are currently 14 roles that describe each contributor’s specific contribution to the scholarly output. They can be assigned multiple times to different authors and one author can also be assigned multiple roles. CRediT includes the following roles: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal Analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing. A description of the different roles can be found in the work of Brand et al., (2015).",
