    "definition": "A collective action platform aiming to support the open science movement by obtaining pledges from researchers that they will implement certain research practices (e.g., pre-registration, pre-print). Initially pledges will be anonymous until a sufficient number of people pledge, upon which names of pledges will be released. The initiative is a grassroots movement instigated by early career researchers.",
