    "definition": "“Reasoning by drawing a conclusion not guaranteed by the premises; for example, by inferring a general rule from a limited number of observations. Popper believed that there was no such logical process; we may guess general rules but such guesses are not rendered even more probable by any number of observations. By contrast, Bayesians inductively work out the increase in probability of a hypothesis that follows from the observations.” Dienes (p. 164, 2008\\)",
