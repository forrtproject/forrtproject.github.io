    "definition": "A statistical error in which a formal test is not conducted to assess the difference between a significant and non-significant correlation (or other measures, such as Odds Ratio). This fallacy occurs when a significant and non-significant correlation coefficient are assumed to represent a statistically significant difference but the comparison itself is not explicitly tested.",
