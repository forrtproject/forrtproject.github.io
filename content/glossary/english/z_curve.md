    "definition": "Computing a Z-score is a statistical approach mainly used to obtain the ‘Estimated Replication Rate’ (ERR) and ‘Expected Discovery Rate’ (EDR) for a set of reported studies. Calculating a z -curve for a set of statistically significant studies involves converting reported p -values to z -scores, fitting a finite mixture model to the distribution of z -scores, and estimating mean power based on the mixture model. The Z-curve analysis can be performed in R through a dedicated package - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zcurve/index.html.",
