    "definition": "The notion that all information relevant to inference contained in data is provided by the likelihood. The principle suggests that the likelihood function can be used to compare the plausibility of various parameter values. While Bayesians and likelihood theorists subscribe to the likelihood principle, Neyman-Pearson theorists do not, as significance tests violate the likelihood principle because they take into account information not in the likelihood.",
