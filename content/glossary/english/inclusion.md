    "definition": "Inclusion, or inclusivity, refers to a sense of welcome and respect within a given collaborative project or environment (such as academia) where *diversity* simply indicates a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, efforts to increase *inclusion* go further to promote engagement and equal valuation among diverse individuals, who might otherwise be marginalized. Increasing inclusivity often involves minimising the impact of, or even removing, systemic barriers to accessibility and engagement.",
