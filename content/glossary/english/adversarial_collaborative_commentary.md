    "title": "Adversarial (collaborative) commentary",
    "definition": "A commentary in which the original authors of a work and critics of said work collaborate to draft a consensus statement. The aim is to draft a commentary that is free of ad hominem attacks and communicates a common understanding or at least identifies where both parties agree and disagree. In doing so, it provides a clear take-home message and path forward, rather than leaving the reader to decide between opposing views conveyed in separate commentaries.",
