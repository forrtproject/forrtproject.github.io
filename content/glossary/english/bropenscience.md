    "definition": "A tongue-in-cheek expression intended to raise awareness of the lack of diverse voices in open science (Bahlai, Bartlett, Burgio et al. 2019; Onie, 2020), in addition to the presence of behavior and communication styles that can be toxic or exclusionary. Importantly, not all bros are men; rather, they are individuals who demonstrate rigid thinking, lack self-awareness, and tend towards hostility, unkindness, and exclusion (Pownall et al., 2021; Whitaker & Guest, 2020). They generally belong to dominant groups who benefit from structural privileges. To address \\#bropenscience, researchers should examine and address structural inequalities within academic systems and institutions.",
