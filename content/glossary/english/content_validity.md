    "definition": "The degree to which a measurement includes all aspects of the concept that the researcher claims to measure; “A qualitative type of validity where the domain of the concept is made clear and the analyst judges whether the measures fully represent the domain” (Bollen, 1989, p.185). It is a component of *construct validity* and can be established using both quantitative and qualitative methods, often involving expert assessment.",
