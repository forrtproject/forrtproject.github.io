    "definition": "Only the name of the consortium or organization appears in the author column, and the individuals' names do not appear in the literature: For example, ‘FORRT’ as an author. This can be seen in the products of collaborative projects with a very large number of collaborators and/or contributors. Depending on the journal policy, individual researchers may be recorded as one of the authors of the product in literature databases such as ORCID and Scopus. Consortium authorship can also be termed group, corporate, organisation/organization or collective authorship (e.g. [https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/article-submission/authorship-contributorship](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/article-submission/authorship-contributorship)), or collaborative authorship (e.g. [https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001449591-What-is-a-group-author-collaborative-author-and-does-it-need-an-ORCID](https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/115001449591-What-is-a-group-author-collaborative-author-and-does-it-need-an-ORCID))",
