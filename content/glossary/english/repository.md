Examples include preprint servers such as bioRxiv, MetaArXiv, PsyArXiv, institutional research repositories, as well as data repositories that collect and store datasets including zenodo.org, PsychData, and code repositories such as Github, or more general repositories for all kinds of research data, such as the Open Science Framework (OSF).
