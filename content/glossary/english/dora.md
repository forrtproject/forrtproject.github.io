    "definition": "The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) is a global initiative aiming to reduce dependence on journal-based metrics (e.g. journal impact factor and citation counts) and, instead, promote a culture which emphasises the intrinsic value of research. The DORA declaration targets research funders, publishers, research institutes and researchers and signing it represents a commitment to aligning research practices and procedures with the declaration’s principles.",
