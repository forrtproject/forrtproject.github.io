    "definition": "A corrigendum (pl. corrigenda, Latin: 'to correct') documents one or multiple errors within a published work that do not alter the central claim or conclusions and thus does not rise to the standard of requiring a retraction of the work. Corrigenda are typically available alongside the original work to aid transparency. Some publishers refer to this document as an erratum (pl. errata, Latin: 'error'), while others draw a distinction between the two (corrigenda as author-errors and errata as publisher-errors).",
