    "definition": "Different individuals have different starting positions (cf. “opportunity gaps”) and needs. Whereas equal treatment focuses on treating all individuals equally , equitable treatment aims to level the playing field by actively increasing opportunities for under-represented minorities. Equitable treatment aims to attain equality through “fairness”: taking into account different needs for support for different individuals, instead of focusing merely on the needs of the majority.",
