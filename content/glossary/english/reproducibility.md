    "definition": "A minimum standard on a spectrum of activities (\"reproducibility spectrum\") for assessing the value or accuracy of scientific claims based on the original methods, data, and code. For instance, where the original researcher's data and computer codes are used to regenerate the results (Barba, 2018), often referred to as computational reproducibility. Reproducibility does not guarantee the quality, correctness, or validity of the published results (Peng, 2011). In some fields, this meaning is, instead, associated with the term “replicability” or ‘repeatability’.",
