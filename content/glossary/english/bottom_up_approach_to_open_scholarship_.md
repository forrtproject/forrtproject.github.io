    "definition": "Within academic culture, an approach focusing on the intrinsic interest of academics to improve the quality of research and research culture, for instance by making it supportive, collaborative, creative and inclusive. Usually indicates leadership from early-career researchers acting as the changemakers driving shifts and change in scientific methodology through enthusiasm and innovation, compared to a “top-down” approach initiated by more senior researchers. \"Bottom-up approaches take into account the specific local circumstances of the case itself, often using empirical data, lived experience, personal accounts, and circumstances as the starting point for developing policy solutions.\"",
