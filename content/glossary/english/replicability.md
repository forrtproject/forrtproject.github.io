    "definition": "An umbrella term, used differently across fields, covering concepts of: direct and conceptual replication, computational reproducibility/replicability, generalizability analysis and robustness analyses. Some of the definitions used previously include: a different team arriving at the same results using the original author's artifacts (Barba 2018); a study arriving at the same conclusion after collecting new data (Claerbout and Karrenbach, 1992); as well as studies for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research (Nosek & Errington, 2020).",
