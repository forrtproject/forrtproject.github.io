    "definition": "An identity confusion, as the individual feels like they have two distinct identities. One is to assimilate to the dominant culture at university when the individual is with colleagues and professors, while the other is when the individual is with their families. This continuous shift may cause a lack of certainty about the individualâ€™s identity and a belief that the individual does not fully belong anywhere. This lack of belonging can lead to poor social integration within the academic culture that can manifest in less opportunities and more mental health issues in the individual (Rubin, 2021; Rubin et al., 2019).",
