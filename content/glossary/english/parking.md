    "definition": "PARKing (preregistering after results are known) is defined as the practice where researchers complete an experiment (possibly with infinite re-experimentation) before preregistering. This practice invalidates the purpose of preregistration, and is one of the QRPs (or, even scientific misconduct) that try to gain only \"credibility that it has been preregistered.\"",
