    "definition": "In typical empirical studies, a single researcher or research team conducts the analysis, which creates uncertainty about the extent to which the choice of analysis influences the results. In multi-analyst studies, two or more researchers independently analyse the same research question or hypothesis on the same dataset. According to Aczel and colleagues (2021), a multi-analyst approach may be beneficial in increasing our confidence in a particular finding; uncovering the impact of analytical preferences across research teams; and highlighting the variability in such analytical approaches.",
