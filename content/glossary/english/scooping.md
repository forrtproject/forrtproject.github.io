    "definition": "The act of reporting or publishing a novel finding prior to another researcher/team. Survey-based research indicates that fear of being scooped is an important fear-related barrier for data sharing in psychology, and agent-based models suggest that competition for priority harms scientific reliability (Tiokhin et al. 2021).",
