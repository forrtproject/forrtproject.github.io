    "definition": "The contextualization of both the research environment and the researcher, to define the boundaries within the research was produced (Jaraf, 2018). Positionality is typically centred and celebrated in qualitative research, but there have been recent calls for it to also be used in quantitative research as well. Positionality statements, whereby a researcher outlines their background and ‘position’ within and towards the research, have been suggested as one method of recognising and centring researcher bias.",
