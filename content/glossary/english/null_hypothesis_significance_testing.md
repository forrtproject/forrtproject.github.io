    "definition": "A frequentist approach to inference used to test the probability of an observed effect against the null hypothesis of no effect/relationship (Pernet, 2015). Such a conclusion is arrived at through use of an index called the p -value. Specifically, researchers will conclude an effect is present when an a priori alpha threshold, set by the researchers, is satisfied; this determines the acceptable level of uncertainty and is closely related to Type I error .",
