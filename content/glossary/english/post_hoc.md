    "definition": "Definition : Post hoc is borrowed from Latin, meaning “after this”. In statistics, post hoc (or post hoc analysis) refers to the testing of hypotheses not specified prior to data analysis. In frequentist statistics, the procedure differs based on whether the analysis was planned or post-hoc, for example by applying more stringent error control. In contrast, Bayesian and likelihood approaches do not differ as a function of when the hypothesis was specified.",
