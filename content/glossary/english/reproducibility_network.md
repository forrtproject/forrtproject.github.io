    "definition": "A reproducibility network is a consortium of open research working groups, often peer-led. The groups operate on a wheel-and-spoke model across a particular country, in which the network connects local cross-disciplinary researchers, groups, and institutions with a central steering group, who also connect with external stakeholders in the research ecosystem. The goals of reproducibility networks include; advocating for greater awareness, promoting training activities, and disseminating best-practices at grassroots, institutional, and research ecosystem levels. Such networks exist in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Australia (as of March 2021).",
