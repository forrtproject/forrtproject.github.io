    "definition": "This is a type of research method which aims to draw general conclusions to address a research question on a certain topic, phenomenon or effect by reviewing research outcomes and information from a range of different sources. Information which is subject to synthesis can be extracted from both qualitative and quantitative studies. The method used to synthesise the gathered information can be qualitative (narrative synthesis), quantitative (meta-analysis) or mixed (meta-synthesis, systematic mapping). Evidence synthesis has many applications and is often used in the context of healthcare, public policy as well as understanding and advancement of specific research fields.",
