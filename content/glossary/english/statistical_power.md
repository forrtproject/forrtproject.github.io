    "definition": "Definition : Statistical power is the long-run p robability that a statistical test correctly rejects the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis is tru e. It ranges from 0 to 1, but is often expressed as a percentage. Power can be estimated using the significance criterion (alpha), effect size, and sample size used for a specific analysis technique. There are two main applications of statistical power. A priori power where the researcher asks the question “given an effect size, how many participants would I need for X% power?”. Sensitiv ity power asks the question “given a known sample size, what effect size could I detect with X% power?” .",
