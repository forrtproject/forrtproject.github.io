    "definition": "Research that poses a threat to those who are or have been involved in it, including the researchers, the participants, and the wider society. This threat can be physical danger (e.g. suicide) or a negative emotional response (e.g. depression) to those who are involved in the research process. For instance, research conducted on victims of suicide, the researcher might be emotionally traumatised by the descriptions of the suicidal behaviours. Indeed, the communication with the victims might also make them re-experience the traumatic memories, leading to negative psychological responses.",
