    "definition": "The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) describes a simple and easy-to-adopt way of organizing neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and behavioral data (i.e., file formats, folder structures). BIDS is a community effort developed by the community for the community and was inspired by the format used internally by the OpenfMRI repository known as   OpenNeuro OpenNeuro . Having initially been developed for fMRI data, the BIDS data structure has been extended for many other measures, such as EEG (Pernet et al., 2019).",
