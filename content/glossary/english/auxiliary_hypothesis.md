    "definition": "All theories contain assumptions about the nature of constructs and how they can be measured. However, not all predictions are derived from theories and assumptions can sometimes be drawn from other premises. Additional assumptions that are made to deduce a prediction and tested by making links to observable data. These auxiliary hypotheses are sometimes invoked to explain why a replication attempt has failed.",
