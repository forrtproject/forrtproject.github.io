    "definition": "P-curve is a tool for identifying potential  publication bias and makes use of the distribution of significant p -values in a series of independent findings. The deviation from the expected right-skewed distribution can be used to assess the existence and degree of publication bias: if the curve is right-skewed, there are more low, highly significant p -values, reflecting an underlying true effect. If the curve is left-skewed, there are many barely significant results just under the 0.05-threshold. This suggests that the studies lack evidential value and may be underpinned by questionable research practices (QRPs; e.g., p-hacking). In the case of no true effect present (true null hypothesis) and unbiased p -value reporting, the p -curve should be a flat, horizontal line, representing the typical distribution of p -values.",
