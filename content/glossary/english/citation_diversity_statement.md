    "definition": "A current effort trying to increase awareness and mitigate the citation bias in relation to gender and race is the Citation Diversity Statement, a short paragraph where “the authors consider their own bias and quantify the equitability of their reference lists. It states: (i) the importance of citation diversity, (ii) the percentage breakdown (or other diversity indicators) of citations in the paper, (iii) the method by which percentages were assessed and its limitations, and (iv) a commitment to improving equitable practices in science” (Zurn et al., 2020, p. 669).",
