    "sort_key": "reproducibility crisis (aka replicability or replication crisis)",
    "definition": "The finding, and related shift in academic culture and thinking, that a large proportion of scientific studies published across disciplines do not replicate (e.g. Open Science Collaboration, 2015). This is considered to be due to a lack of quality and integrity of research and publication practices, such as publication bias, QRPs and a lack of transparency, leading to an inflated rate of false positive results. Others have described this process as a ‘Credibility revolution’ towards improving these practices.",
