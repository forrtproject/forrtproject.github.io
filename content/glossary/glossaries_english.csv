Criterion validity , The degree to which a measure corresponds to other valid measures of the same concept. Criterion validity is usually established by calculating regression coefficients or bivariate correlations estimating the direction and strength of relation between test measure and criterion measure. It is often confused with *construct validity* although it differs from it in intent (merely predictive rather than theoretical) and interest (predicting an observable outcome rather than a latent construct).

Crowdsourced Research ," Crowdsourced research is a model of the social organisation of research as a large-scale collaboration in which one or more research projects are conducted by multiple teams in an independent yet coordinated manner. Crowdsourced research aims at achieving efficiency and scalability gains by pooling resources, promoting transparency and social inclusion, as well as increasing the rigor, reliability, and trustworthiness by enhancing statistical power and mutual social vetting. It stands in contrast to the traditional model of academic research production, which is dominated by the independent work of individual or small groups of researchers (‘small science’). Examples of crowdsourced research include so-called ‘many labs replication’ studies (Klein et al., 2018), ‘many analysts, one dataset’ studies (Silberzahn et al., 2018), distributive collaborative networks (Moshontz et al., 2018\) and open collaborative writing projects such as Massively Open Online Papers (MOOPs) (Himmelstein et al., 2019; Tennant et al., 2019). Alternatively, crowdsourced research can refer to the use of a large number of research “crowdworkers” in data collection hired through online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific, for example in content analysis (Benoit et al., 2016; Lind et al., 2017\) or experimental research (Peer et al., 2017).

Direct replication ," As ‘direct replication’ does not have a widely-agreed technical meaning nor there is no clear cut distinction between a direct and conceptual replication, below we list several contributions towards a consensus. Rather than debating the ‘exactness’ of a replication, it is more helpful to discuss the relevant differences between a replication and its target, and their implications for the reliability and generality of the target’s results. Generally, direct replication refers to a new data collection that attempts to replicate original studies’ methods as closely as possible. A replication attempt that “seek(s) to duplicate the necessary elements that produced the original finding.” (Cruwell et al., 2019; p.243). The purpose of a direct replication can be to identify type 1 errors and/or experimenter effects, determine the replicability of an effect using the same or improved practices, or to create more specific estimates of effect size (Hűffmeier et al., 2016). Directness of replication is a continuum between repeating specific observations (data) and observing generalised effects (phenomena). How closely a replication replicates an original study is often a matter for debate, often with differences being cited as hidden moderators of effects. Furthermore, there can be debate over the relevant importance of technical equivalence (i.e., using identical materials) versus psychological equivalence (i.e., realizing the identical psychological conditions) to the original study (Schwarz and Strack, 2014). For example, consider a study on Trust in the US- President conducted in 2018\. A technical equivalent replication would use Trump as stimulus (he was president in 2018\) a psychological equivalent study would use Biden (he is the current president)."," \[@Cruwell2019,\], \[@Huffmeier2016\], \[@LeBel2017\], \[@SchwarzStrack2014\]",NA, Beatrix Arendt; Adrien Fillon; Matt Jaquiery; Charlotte R.

Equivalence Testing ," Equivalence tests statistically assess the null hypothesis that a given effect exceeds a minimum criterion to be considered meaningful. Thus, rejection of the null hypothesis provides evidence of a lack of (meaningful) effect. Based upon frequentist statistics, equivalence tests work by specifying equivalence bounds: a lower and upper value that reflect the smallest effect size of interest. Two one-sided *t*\-tests are then conducted against each of these equivalence bounds to assess whether effects that are deemed meaningful can be *rejected* (see Schuirmann, 1972; Lakens et al., 2018; 2020)."," \[@Lakens2018\], \[@LakensEtAl2020\], \[@Schuirmann1987\]", Charlotte R.

Error detection," Broadly refers to examining research data and manuscripts for mistakes or inconsistencies in reporting.

Literature Review ," Researchers often review research records on a given topic to better understand effects and phenomena of interest before embarking on a new research project, to understand how theory links to evidence or to investigate common themes and directions of existing study results and claims. Different types of reviews can be conducted depending on the research question and literature scope. To determine the scope and key concepts in a given field, researchers may want to conduct a scoping literature review. Systematic reviews aim to access and review all available records for the most accurate and unbiased representation of existing literature. Non-systematic or focused literature reviews synthesise information from a selection of studies relevant to the research question although they are uncommon due to susceptibility to biases (e.g. researcher bias; Siddaway et al., 2019)."," \[@Huelin2015\], \[@Munn2018\], \[@Pautasso2013\], \[@Siddaway2019\]",NA," Jamie P.

Different types of reviews can be conducted depending on the research question and literature scope. To determine the scope and key concepts in a given field, researchers may want to conduct a scoping literature review. Systematic reviews aim to access and review all available records for the most accurate and unbiased representation of existing literature.

Social class ," Social class is usually measured using both objective and subjective measurements, as recommended by the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association,Task Force on Socioeconomic Status, 2007). Unlike the conventional concept, which only considers one factor, either education or income (e.g., economic variables), an individual's social class is considered to be a combination of their education, income, occupational prestige, subjective social status, and self-identified social class. Social class is partly a cultural variable, as it is a stable variable and likely to change slowly over the years. Social class can have important implications to academic outcomes. An individual may have a high socio-economic status yet identify as a working class individual. Working class students tend to have different life circumstances and often more restrictive commitments than middle-class students, which make their integration with other students more difficult (Rubin, 2021). The lack of time and money is obstructive to their social experience at university. Working class students are more likely to work to support themselves, resulting in less time for academic activities and for socializing with other students as well as less money to purchase items linked to social experiences (e.g. food)."," Evans and Rubin (2021); Rubin et al.

Social integration ," Social integration is a multi-dimensional construct. In an academic context, social integration is related to the quantity and quality of the social interactions with staff and students, as well as the sense of connection and belonging to the university and the people within the institute. To be more specific, social support, trust, and connectedness are all variables that contribute to social integration. Social integration has important implications for academic outcomes and mental wellbeing (Evans & Rubin, 2021). Working class students are less likely to integrate with other students, since they have differing social and economic backgrounds and less disposable income. Thus they are not able to experience as many educational and fiscal opportunities than others. In turn, this can lead to poor mental health and feelings of ostracism (Rubin, 2021)."," Evans and Rubin (2021); Rubin et al.

Validity ," Validity refers to the application of statistical principles to arrive at well-founded —i.e., likely corresponding accurately to the real world— concepts, conclusions or measurement. In psychometrics, validity refers to the extent to which something measures what it intends to or claims to measure. Under this generic term, there are different types of validity (e.g., internal validity, construct validity, face validity, criterion validity, diagnostic validity, discriminant validity, concurrent validity, convergent validity, predictive validity, external validity)."," Campbell (1957); Boorsboom et al.

Version control ," The practice of managing and recording changes to digital resources (e.g. files, websites, programmes, etc.) over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control systems are designed to record the history of changes (who, what and when), and help to avoid human errors (e.g. working on the wrong version). For example, the Git version control system is a widely used software tool that originally helped software developers to version control shared code and is now used across many scientific disciplines to manage and share files.", [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)  \[@GitVersionControl\],NA, Sarah Ashcroft-Jones; Thomas Rhys Evans; Helena Hartmann; Matt Jaquiery; Adam Parker; Charlotte R.
