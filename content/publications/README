# How to Add Publications

This folder contains PDF files and other publication-related assets. The actual publication data is stored in `/data/publications.yaml` (NOT in this folder).

## Adding a New Publication

Publications are managed in the **`/data/publications.yaml`** file. This file contains all publication metadata that is displayed on the website.

### Steps to Add a Publication

1. **Open** `/data/publications.yaml`
2. **Find** the appropriate section based on publication type:
   - `# --- Academic Peer-Reviewed Publications ---` for journal articles
   - `# --- Preprints ---` for preprints
   - `# --- Op-Eds and Media ---` for media/op-eds
   - `# --- Policy Briefs ---` for policy documents
   - `# --- Affiliated Projects ---` for affiliated work
   - `# --- Work in Progress ---` for ongoing projects

3. **Add** your publication entry using the structure below
4. **Increment** the comment number (e.g., `# 1`, `# 2`, etc.)
5. **Save** the file

### Publication Entry Structure

```yaml
# [Number]
- title: "Full Title of the Publication"
  type: "journal"  # Options: journal, preprint, media, policy, affiliated, wip
  year: "2025"
  status: "Published"  # Options: Published, Preprint, In Press, Work in Progress, etc.
  journal_name: "Name of Journal or Venue"
  authors: "Author1, Author2, & Author3"
  abstract: "Full abstract text here. Can be multiple sentences describing the work."
  citation: "Author1, et al. (2025). <strong>Title in bold.</strong> <em>Journal Name in italics</em>, volume(issue), pages. https://doi.org/..."
  links:
    doi: "https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx"  # Optional
    pdf: "./filename.pdf"  # Optional - relative path to PDF in this folder
    postprint: "https://osf.io/preprints/..."  # Optional
    project: "/project-page-url"  # Optional
    url: "https://external-link.com"  # Optional
  altmetric_doi: "10.xxxx/xxxxx"  # Optional - for Altmetric badge
  altmetric_doi_2: "10.xxxx/xxxxx"  # Optional - for second Altmetric badge
  focus_area: "Research Area Name"  # RECOMMENDED - see Research Areas below
```

### Research Areas (focus_area)

Publications can be classified into one or more of these research areas. While the field currently only supports a single value, the classification helps readers filter publications:

- **"Meta-Research & Scientific Reform"** - For work on replication, reproducibility, research methods, scientific reform, open science infrastructure
- **"Equity, Diversity & Social Justice"** - For work on neurodiversity, inclusion, accessibility, citational justice, DEI in academia
- **"Community, Governance & Sustainability"** - For work on community building, governance, sustainability, open science communities
- **"Education & Pedagogy"** - For work on teaching, learning, pedagogical methods, educational resources

**Note:** Choose the most appropriate single category. If multiple categories apply, select the primary focus.

### Field Descriptions

- **title**: Full publication title (in quotes)
- **type**: Category of publication - determines which section it appears in
- **year**: Publication year (in quotes)
- **status**: Publication status for display
- **journal_name**: Where the work was published/presented
- **authors**: Author list (use "et al." for long lists if needed)
- **abstract**: Brief description or abstract of the work
- **citation**: Full formatted citation using HTML tags (`<strong>` for title, `<em>` for journal)
- **links**: Object containing various link types (see options above)
- **altmetric_doi**: DOI for Altmetric badge (displays article metrics)
- **focus_area**: Research area classification (RECOMMENDED - helps with filtering)

### Link Types

You can include multiple link types in the `links:` section:

- `doi`: Direct link to the DOI
- `pdf`: Link to PDF file (can be relative `./file.pdf` or absolute URL)
- `postprint`: Link to preprint/postprint version
- `project`: Link to related project page
- `url`: Generic external link

### Adding PDF Files

If you want to host a PDF in this repository:

1. **Save** the PDF file in `/content/publications/` or `/content/publications/pdf/`
2. **Reference** it in your YAML entry:
   ```yaml
   links:
     pdf: "./filename.pdf"
     # or
     pdf: "./pdf/filename.pdf"
   ```

### Example Entry

```yaml
# 1
- title: "Open Science Practices Improve Research Quality"
  type: "journal"
  year: "2025"
  status: "Published"
  journal_name: "Nature"
  authors: "Smith, J., Johnson, A., & Williams, B."
  abstract: "This study demonstrates how open science practices lead to more robust and reproducible research findings across multiple disciplines."
  citation: "Smith, J., Johnson, A., and Williams, B. (2025). <strong>Open science practices improve research quality.</strong> <em>Nature</em>, 600(1), 123-145. https://doi.org/10.1038/example"
  links:
    doi: "https://doi.org/10.1038/example"
    postprint: "https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/abc123"
    project: "/open-science-toolkit"
  altmetric_doi: "10.1038/example"
  focus_area: "Meta-Research & Scientific Reform"
```

### Important Notes

- **YAML Syntax**: Be careful with indentation (use 2 spaces, not tabs)
- **Quotes**: Use quotes around values that contain special characters or colons
- **HTML in Citations**: Use `<strong>` for titles and `<em>` for journal names
- **Focus Area**: Always add a focus_area to help with website filtering
- **Testing**: After adding, rebuild the site locally to verify formatting

### Need Help?

If you encounter issues or have questions about adding publications, please:
- Check existing entries in the file for reference
- Ensure YAML syntax is correct (indentation, quotes)
- Verify all required fields are present
- Test locally before committing changes
