### **The Replication Database: Documenting the Replicability of Psychological Science**

<br>

We have written a manuscript about documenting and tracking replication efforts. In psychological science, replicability — repeating a study with a new sample achieving consistent results — is critical for affirming the validity of scientific findings. Despite its importance, replication efforts are few and far between in psychological science with many attempts failing to corroborate past findings. This scarcity, compounded by the difficulty in accessing replication data, jeopardizes the efficient allocation of research resources and impedes scientific advancement. Addressing this crucial gap, we present the [Replication Database](https://forrt.org/replication-hub/), a novel platform hosting >1,200 original findings paired with replication findings. The infrastructure of this database allows researchers to submit, access, and engage with replication findings. The database makes replications visible, easily findable via a graphical user interface, and tracks replication rates across various factors, such as publication year or journal. This will facilitate future efforts to evaluate the robustness of psychological research. More info about the project and other FORRT replication efforts can be found on the [Replication Hub](https://forrt.org/replication-hub/#). This effort was also highlighted by the journal _Science_ in their [news at a glance](https://www.science.org/content/article/news-glance-planning-mentoring-tracking-replications-and-deracializing-lung-tests)!

### **The Impact of Open Scholarship on Students' Learning Outcomes (Scoping Review)**

<br>

We have written a manuscript entitled *Teaching open and reproducible scholarship: a critical review of the evidence base for current pedagogical methods and their outcomes*. This manuscript describes the available (empirical) evidence of the impact (and importance) of integrating open scholarship into higher education, its benefits and challenges on three specific areas: students’ (a) scientific literacy; (b) engagement with science; and (c) attitudes towards science. This paper was borne out of colleagues reporting a need for something tangible to take to Heads of Departments to show pedagogical rationale for open scholarship (above and beyond the moral/'good for science' case that wasn't always being heard on the ground).

### Improvements since the Replication Crisis: The Structural, Procedural, and Community Changes

<br>

We have written a manuscript entitled *The replication crisis has led to positive structural, procedural, and community changes*. This manuscript reviews how research structures, procedures and communities have changed in response to the replication crisis, showing that the replication "crisis" has been a positive *credibility revolution*. We also outline how improvements can continue to be made by accounting for all three levels. This manuscript was born out of the fact that much of the literature on the Replication Crisis has focused on understanding the potential underlying causes of low replicability, and framing solutions as a matter of individual researcher reform, and our community wanted to provide a wider perspective on what has been learnt since the crisis by highlighting the role of structural, procedural factors, and evidencing the rapid progress made by social scientists as a response.

### **FORRT's Lesson Plans**

<br>

Despite the growing awareness of the benefits of training reproducible methods within undergraduate and postgraduate curricula, there remains a lack of systematic incorporation of open scholarship practices in taught courses across Higher Education. While the potential reasons for this are diverse, one reason may be the dearth of available ready-to-use educational resources. To support instructors aiming to bridge that gap, FORRT's community built open educational resources that can be integrated into taught courses ‘out of the box’. As creating or changing course content can be onerous and time-consuming, we aimed to make evidence-based, high-quality lesson plans and activities available to teaching faculty, thus reducing the labour required to develop and implement open scholarship content. We compiled lesson plans and activities, and categorized them based on their theme, learning outcome, and method of delivery, which are made publicly available here: [FORRT's Lesson Plans](/lesson-plans).

### **Neurodiversity & Open Scholarship in Academia**

<br>

We have written a manuscript entitled *Bridging Neurodiversity and Open Scholarship: How Shared Values Can Guide Best Practices for Research Integrity, Social Justice, and Principled Education* explaining that Neurodiversity is fundamental to the understanding of human behaviour and cognition and that neurodivergent individuals are often stigmatised, devalued, and objectified. The authors describe systematic barriers, issue with disclosure, directions on prevalence and stigma, intersection of neurodiversity and open scholarship, and provide recommendations that can lead to personal and systematic changes to improve acceptance of neurodivergent individuals. We also present the perspectives of neurodivergent authors, the majority of whom have personal lived experiences of neurodivergence(s), and provide recommendations for how research and academia can and should be improved in terms of research integrity, inclusivity and diversity. We end with discussing systematic barriers, issue with disclosure, directions on prevalence and stigma, intersection of neurodiversity and open scholarship, and provide recommendations that can lead to personal and systematic changes to improve acceptance of neurodivergent individuals.

### **Point of View: An annotated introductory reading list for neurodiversity**

<br>

Since its inception, the concept of neurodiversity has been defined in a number of different ways, which can cause confusion among those hoping to educate themselves about the topic. Learning about neurodiversity can also be challenging because there is a lack of well-curated, appropriately contextualized information on the topic. To address such barriers, we present an annotated reading list that was developed collaboratively by a neurodiverse group of researchers. The nine themes covered in the reading list are: the history of neurodiversity; ways of thinking about neurodiversity; the importance of lived experience; a neurodiversity paradigm for autism science; beyond deficit views of ADHD; expanding the scope of neurodiversity; anti-ableism; the need for robust theory and methods; and integration with open and participatory work. We hope this resource can support readers in understanding some of the key ideas and topics within neurodiversity, and that it can further orient researchers towards more rigorous, destigmatizing, accessible, and inclusive scientific practices.

### **<font style="color:#4c1322">Policy</font>** | **Open Scholarship in QAA Briefing**

<br> 

FORRT was asked by the UK's Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) to produce a short briefing note in collaboration with the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) about the importance of embedding open scholarship into higher education. In the note, we argued that students need to understand and experience open and rigorous research processes to become effective and responsible consumers of evidence. We structured this around three themes (Thinking About Research, Doing Research, and Engaging With Research) and showed how this can be implemented across different fields. 

The **<font style="color:#0e2a38">briefing note</font>** can [be found here](2023_QAA%20_%20FORRT_UKRN.pdf).

### **<font style="color:#4c1322">Policy</font>** | **Building Community**

<br>

FORRT responded to the the call from the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on for [evidence on reproducibility and research integrity, and the roles different institutions play in this](https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/562) arguing that one important component of research integrity that is often absent from discussion: the pedagogical consequences of how we teach, mentor, and supervise students through *open scholarship*. Our argument boils down to 'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.'

### **<font style="color:#4c1322">Policy</font>** | **Briefing Note for Degree Accrediting Societies**

<br>

We have written to UKRN (UK's Reproducibility Network) and the British Psychological Society (BPS) a short note on our organization and goals, as well as providing 3 (three) recommendations:

1) We ask that degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions endorse FORRT as a valuable tool for educators. Both as an educational self-assessment of current teaching content, and as a resource for successful implemented pedagogies.
2) We ask that degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions support and promote the opening of teaching materials, to support educators to integrate principles of open and reproducible research in their own teaching and mentoring materials.
3) We ask that representatives from degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions meet with FORRT to discuss partnerships and shared educational aspirations with FORRT.
