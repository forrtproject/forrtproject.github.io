## **FORRT's Manifesto | Main Manuscript**

<br>

We have written a manuscript entitled *Introducing a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT)* describing the importance of integrating open scholarship into higher education, its benefits and challenges, as well as about FORRT initiatives aiming to support educators in this endeavor. 

The **<font style="color:#0e2a38">preprint</font>** can [be found here (osf.io/bnh7p)](https://osf.io/bnh7p).

## **FORRT's Glossary**

<br>

We have conducted an open educational resource project [FORRT's Glossary](/glossary) in response to the varied and plural new terminology introduced by the *open scholarship* movement, which has transformed academia's lexicon, to facilitate education and effective communication between experts and newcomers. We have written a manuscript entitled *A Community-Sourced Glossary of Open Scholarship Terms* presenting the beta 0.1 version of our glossary of open scholarship terms to facilitate education and effective communication between experts and newcomers.

## **FORRT's Lesson Plans**

<br>

We have conducted an open educational resource project [FORRT's Lesson Plans](/lesson-plans) in response to the varied and plural new terminology introduced by the *open scholarship* movement, which has transformed academia's lexicon, to facilitate education and effective communication between experts and newcomers. We have written a manuscript entitled *A Community-Sourced Glossary of Open Scholarship Terms* presenting the beta 0.1 version of our glossary of open scholarship terms to facilitate education and effective communication between experts and newcomers.

## **The Role of Pedagogical Communities**

<br>

We have written a manuscript entitled *Towards a culture of open scholarship: The role of pedagogical communities* describing (a) the the need to integrate open scholarship principles into research training within higher education; (b) the benefit of pedagogical communities and the role they play in fostering an inclusive culture of open scholarship; and (c)  call for greater collaboration with pedagogical communities, paving the way for a much needed integration of top-down and grassroot open scholarship initiatives.

## **<font style="color:#4c1322">Policy</font>** | **Building Community**

<br>

FORRT responded to the the call from the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on for [evidence on reproducibility and research integrity, and the roles different institutions play in this](https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/562) arguing that one important component of research integrity that is often absent from discussion: the pedagogical consequences of how we teach, mentor, and supervise students through *open scholarship*.

## **<font style="color:#4c1322">Policy</font>** | **Briefing Note for Degree Accrediting Societies**

<br>

We have written to UKRN (UK's Reproducibility Network) and the British Psychological Society (BPS) a short note on our organization and goals, as well as providing 3 (three) recommendations:

1) We ask that degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions endorse FORRT as a valuable tool for educators. Both as an educational self-assessment of current teaching content, and as a resource for successful implemented pedagogies.
2) We ask that degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions support and promote the opening of teaching materials, to support educators to integrate principles of open and reproducible research in their own teaching and mentoring materials.
3) We ask that representatives from degree accrediting societies and higher education institutions meet with FORRT to discuss partnerships and shared educational aspirations with FORRT. 

The **<font style="color:#0e2a38">briefing note</font>** can [be found here](Parsons_Azevedo_FORRT_UKRN_Briefing_note_for_degree_accrediting_societies.pdf).

***Status***: Our briefing note was informative to UKRN & the British Psychological Society.
