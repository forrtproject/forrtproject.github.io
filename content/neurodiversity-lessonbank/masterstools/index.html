<p><strong>Activity 1&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Read and discuss the following citations:<br></p>  

<p><em>1. Psychology of oppression reveals t<span>hat
<span style="">oppression is not always perceptible and repellant</span>. It</span> can be disguised and
beguiling. People do not always know they are oppressed. Sometimes they have to
be educated about their oppression. The reason is that oppression stunts
people’s critical, rational, analytical, and probing capabilities. Normative
oppression also becomes taken for granted and mundane and therefore
imperceptible</em> (Ratner, 2014).</p>

<p><em>2. People cannot reject the system of
domination without rejecting [part of] themselves, their own repressive
 instinctual needs and values </em> (Marcuse,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5583-7_571#ref-CR161164" title="Marcuse, H. (1969). An essay on liberation. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.">1969</a>, p. 17).</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<em>Advocating the mere tolerance of difference between women is the grossest reformism.
It is a total denial of the creative function of difference in our lives. Difference must be
not merely tolerated, but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our
creativity can spark like a dialectic. Only then does the necessity for interdependency 
 Lorde 2
become unthreatening. Only within that interdependency of difference strengths,
acknowledged and equal, can the power to seek new ways of being in the world generate,
as well as the courage and sustenance to act where there are no charters </em>(Lorde, 1984)<em>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Activity 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><em>Now read the short essay written by Audre Lorde in 1984. What does she mean when she says that the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house?</em></span></p>

 <p>How do you understand these words? What do you think about them?</p>
  

<p><strong>Activity 3</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Now read Nick Walker's essay titled "Throw away the master's tools: Liberating ourselves from the pathology paradigm." What is he advocating for? What alternative to the pathology paradigm does he propose?&nbsp; Can you explain the difference and summarise his arguments?</em></p>

  <p>What do Critical gender Theory, Critical Race Theory and Critical Neurodiversity Theory have in common?</p>
