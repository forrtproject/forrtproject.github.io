Can you add anything else?</em></span></p><p><br></p><p></p><p><span>Here are some specific examples of problems caused by the generalizability crisis. Match them to the titles:</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p></p><ul><li><span><strong>Some groups might be disadvantaged regarding depression treatment</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Lack of representation of diverse populations in clinical trials</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Some groups overlooked in genetic research</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Inaccurate treatment recommendations for women</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>Black skin conditions not as easy to treat</strong></span></li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p></p><ol><li><p>Some studies on dermatological conditions have found that certain treatments may not be as effective for black patients due to differences in skin biology. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found that black patients with acne may have more resistant and inflammatory acne than white patients, which may require different treatment approaches.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Many clinical trials have historically excluded certain populations, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and older adults. This can limit our understanding of how certain treatments or interventions work in these populations. For example, a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that cancer clinical trials often underrepresent racial and ethnic minorities, which can limit our understanding of the effectiveness of cancer treatments in these populations.</p></li><li><p>Many studies on cardiovascular disease have historically focused on men, which can lead to inaccurate treatment recommendations for women. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that women are less likely than men to receive evidence-based treatments for heart attacks, which can result in worse outcomes.</p></li><li><p>Some genetic research has been criticized for being too focused on populations of European ancestry, which can limit our understanding of genetic diversity and disease risk in other populations. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found that many genetic studies have underrepresented or excluded African populations, which can limit our understanding of genetic diversity and disease risk in these populations.</p></li><li><p>Some mental health studies have focused on populations from Western cultures, which can limit our understanding of mental health in other cultures. For example, a study published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology found that many measures of depression and anxiety may not be appropriate for use in non-Western cultures, which can limit our understanding of mental health in these populations.</p></li></ol><br><p></p>



</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Activity 4 - Strategies to address the problem</strong><br></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><span><em style="">Look back at the case studies and discuss / reflect on how these flaws could be addressed.
