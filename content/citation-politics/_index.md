## Overview

Citations can be thought of as a currency in the academy, where more citations equals more prestige. While the system assumes a meritocracy—where higher citation counts supposedly indicate higher quality because a work is deemed valuable and legitimate by peers—this perspective ignores inherent biases and systemic inequalities. In reality, citation practices often function as mechanisms of exclusion, gatekeeping, and reproduction of existing power structures, reinforcing the dominance of certain groups over others. These issues span from individual choices in citation to structural issues with search engines; here we introduce a toolkit that individuals can use to encourage a conscientious, and more just, citation practice.

The Citational Justice Toolkit organizes a collection of tools and practices by their application to four stages of the research cycle: planning, project, paper and publication. Researchers are encouraged to apply any tool or practice, or as many as they wish, at any point in the research cycle. Many of these tools and practices can become integrated into regular research workflow, ultimately leading to more just citational practices as a matter of course.

The aim of this toolkit is to encourage individual researchers to become conscientious in their citation practices, using their citation choices to distribute power more equitably in the academy. We invite you to explore the Citational Justice Toolkit and join us in promoting equity and justice in academia.

# Toolkit

We provide a suite of resources to support the use and implementation of the Citational Justice Toolkit:

## Manuscript: 

**coming Soon**

## Toolkit Website

**Citation Self-Audit**: [to be created through Sarah’s BA/Leverhulme grant] This guide walks you through using the Citational Justice Toolkit to conduct an audit on your own work and more importantly - how to pinpoint tools and practices to help you make targeted changes.

## FORRT citational justice module: 

**Diversify Your Content Workshop**: [to be created through Sarah’s BA/Leverhulme grant] This workshop guides you through applying the Citational Justice Workshop to teaching content using focused questions to target changes.

## Get involved!

This toolkit and accompanying manuscript are only the first piece of work produced by the FORRT Citational Politics Working Group. If you have any other ideas or suggestions for development of the toolkit, or other ways of engaging with citational practice or patterns (especially as it relates to open research), get in touch with Sarah Sauve or Helena Gellersen on FORRT’s Slack.
