FORRT is excited to launch the Open Research Games Portal – a crowdsourced, pedagogically informed database of games and interactive activities for teaching open and reproducible research practices. This initiative recognizes the power of game-based learning to make complex topics more accessible, memorable, and engaging for learners – from students and early-career researchers to educators and professionals. Whether you're looking for a lighthearted icebreaker or a serious, learning-focused game to integrate into your curriculum, the Portal helps you find what you need.

## What’s in the Portal

We gather extensive information on each game – from metadata and gameplay characteristics to user testimonials, formal evaluations (when available), preparation requirements, and pedagogical suggestions for teaching. This depth is made possible through crowdsourcing: anyone can add missing information and share their experiences with a game, which helps everyone navigate the growing collection of open research games more easily. The Portal serves as an open-access resource offering both digital and physical games that support learning through play, collaboration, and critical thinking.

## Navigate the Portal

You can search and filter games using topic tags, FORRT Clusters, gameplay styles (competitive, collaborative, etc.), and other criteria to find exactly what you're looking for. And importantly, we show you where to find and access these games.


## How to contribute

Use our [Additions Form](https://forms.gle/MSBWR87GchDo8fED7) to add information about games already in the Portal, or the [New Entries Form](https://forms.gle/PXYBrRhXGiZyi8M99) to add games we're missing. You can add any game you know of, even if you haven't played it yourself – the community will fill in the rest!

You can find the Open Research Games Portal [here](https://forrtapps.shinyapps.io/open-research-games-portal/)

We're continuing to improve the Portal and would love your feedback on both the database and our forms. Please reach out to [games@forrt.com](games@forrt.com) with any comments or suggestions.
