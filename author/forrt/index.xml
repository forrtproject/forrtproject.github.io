&lt;h3 id="background-of-reviewer-zero">Background of Reviewer Zero&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The experiences with peer review that we share here are, unfortunately, not uncommon. Comments like these – and others that are unduly harsh, belittling, racist, sexist, or otherwise inappropriate – have been received by scholars at all career stages during peer review. These experiences provide a starting point to question normative practices in scientific peer review, and identify the hidden and blatant consequences for early career scholars - particularly those from underserved groups. Most importantly, we can ask what each of us might do to shift this culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.reviewerzero.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reviewer Zero&lt;/a> is a collective founded in 2020 to take concrete, data-driven, anti-racist action to improve the culture of scientific peer review. We were formed with guidance from
&lt;a href="https://www.sparksociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPARK Society&lt;/a> — an organization that improves visibility and provides mentorship opportunities for cognitive scientists of color. Our broad aim is to change cultural norms in the peer review process, in order to improve the recruitment, retention, and advancement of minoritized scholars in psychology. Collectively, we are a group who has experienced hundreds of rejections and written hundreds of reviews. We’ve received decision letters accepting and rejecting our work, and we have written decision letters accepting or rejecting others’ work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like readers of this blog, Reviewer Zero members know that science can be better than it is, and that shifting the status quo is not easy. The culture of science matters for who engages with it, and normative experiences within a culture can produce different consequences if individuals see themselves as safe or threatened within that culture. The experience of peer review as hostile or negative sets the stage for disparate impacts for minoritized individuals. For example, a survey of peer review experience
&lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wtZdP5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Silbiger &amp;amp; Stubler, 2019)&lt;/a> found that experiences of unprofessional peer review were quite common - reported by 50% of scientists in the survey. However, individuals from minoritized groups reported a stronger negative impact of these unprofessional reviews, compounding the impact of other biases against such individuals (see our forthcoming review Aly et al., in press, for further discussion;
&lt;a href="https://psyarxiv.com/435xz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprint available&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To understand peer review from the perspective of early career researchers who are underserved by the status quo, Reviewer Zero conducted a survey in 2020 of early career researchers in psychology / neuroscience.
&lt;a href="https://osf.io/jqy4k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our results&lt;/a> are not surprising: We found that cis-men of color reported less helpful feedback compared to White cis-men, and women/nonbinary respondents were more likely than cis-men to report that their peer review experience reduced their belonging in science. Qualitative results from a free-response question about the most memorable experiences with peer review were eye-opening, and heartbreaking. Respondents reported receiving harsh feedback, racist comments, and feeling so demotivated that they left those research topics behind. But there is also opportunity for change: This survey also showed that authors can feel motivated when the process is perceived as fair or when reviews note strengths of the work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Harsh reviewer comments can have disparate impacts, demotivating early career researchers and driving them away from the field.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="how-reviewer-zeros-mission-intersects-with-the-open-science-community">How Reviewer Zero’s Mission Intersects with the Open Science Community&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As efforts to improve scientific practice and policy toward more openness and transparency take shape, it is essential to consider who is designing these systems and what perspectives they reflect. To build systems that are truly open and accessible for a global psychological science, we must take proactive steps to include different perspectives, identities, and voices in creating and changing systems. Here, we walk through examples of two kinds of openness that can have implications for minoritized or underserved groups. The essential questions are who is being asked to be “open,” and at what cost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One innovation in peer review is
&lt;a href="https://forrt.org/glossary/open-peer-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open peer review&lt;/a>, which includes disclosure of author and reviewer identities and reviews. Open peer review can include different levels of disclosure: For example, greater transparency without identification can occur if reviews are public but reviewers are not identified. Although identified peer review can have some advantages in that reviewers are clearly accountable to what they write in a review, this system may not be equitably open to all. Individuals who occupy less powerful positions, whether due to their career stage or underrepresented group identities, may experience more backlash or more negative consequences in offering critique – or their perspectives may simply be dismissed in favor of reviews from people who hold more power or come from majority groups. Transparent peer review, where reviews are public but reviewer identities are not, might offer greater security to reviewers. From an author perspective, though, individuals who are contending with identity threat may be unwilling (for good reason) to have critiques of their work openly aired (for further discussion, see our forthcoming review paper; Aly et al., in press). The very ability to engage in different aspects of open peer review can vary across individuals with different levels of power in a system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Would greater openness in peer review make hostile and unprofessional reviews less likely, or would greater openness in peer review exacerbate negative consequences for members of historically excluded groups? We don’t know the answer to these questions, but we need to ask them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that hostile or unprofessional reviews can be common, individuals from historically excluded groups might steer away from participating in open review processes. Navigating peer review is challenging enough without doing so in public. One example comes from Dr. Colleen Murphy, who tweeted in response to
&lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/54d63486/elife-s-new-model-changing-the-way-you-share-your-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eLife’s move to drop accept/reject decisions&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="tweet_rz.png" alt="Tweet about misogynistic peer-review" title="Tweet about misogynistic peer-review">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inequities present in peer review need to be addressed before there is any possibility of open review serving a wide range of scholars. Without a deliberate effort to change the existing culture in a way that advances diversity, equity, and inclusion, other efforts might perpetuate or exacerbate these inequities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A different form of openness, transparency, and accountability in peer review comes from institutions or organizations. It is not yet routine for journals, societies, or editors to collect or share aggregate-level data about the demographic or identity characteristics of editors, editorial board members, reviewers, or authors. Yet knowing this information could provide valuable insights about who is served by the current practices and how that might change with reforms. What are the demographic or identity characteristics of the editorial board and reviewers? Who is submitting papers, who is being invited to resubmit papers, who appeals editorial decisions, and what are the outcomes? Data about these aspects of scientific publishing are rarely collected, rarely examined by journal staff, and are even more rarely shared with the community. Without transparency and accountability in terms of representation, editor and reviewer choices tend to rely on individuals’ own social networks and perpetuate gender and race homophily. This reliance on social networks may be exacerbated by the growing difficulties with finding scholars to agree to provide peer reviews (Petrescu &amp;amp; Krishen, 2022). Editors may rely on close colleagues who are willing to do them a favor by providing a review, which can in turn further narrow the pool of reviewers and the types of feedback authors get. To counteract this tendency, journals can publicize calls for individuals to register as new reviewers, so that editors have accessible and current listings of scholars with expertise and availability. Generally speaking, clearer and more transparent data about who engages with peer review and how they do so can inform innovations to ease burdens on editors and provide more diverse slates of reviewers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-reviewer-zero-and-forrt-work-together">How Reviewer Zero and FORRT work together&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Like FORRT, Reviewer Zero seeks to illuminate the black box of scientific and academic culture. Peer review is central to scientific careers, but peer review is often left to the “hidden curriculum” of processes that people learn as they go without explicit discussion or training. To bring some light to these unknown processes, Reviewer Zero hosts workshops (both online and at in-person conferences) for both early-career scholars and for editors and reviewers. In the sessions aimed at trainees and early career scholars, we introduce the basics of peer review, to consider the emotional and motivational aspects of navigating peer review, and to provide concrete tools and strategies for responding to editorial decisions. In workshops with editorial teams, we lead discussions about the current culture of peer review and its implications for perpetuating disparities in who contributes to and advances in science, and we discuss concrete steps toward a more constructive and inclusive peer review culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reviewer Zero is developing
&lt;a href="https://osf.io/e7z5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-demand resources&lt;/a> based on these workshops, and these can complement FORRT resources offered in the adopting principled education section of the website. We particularly advocate for collaboration and conversation moving forward, for identification and promotion of strategies that can advance diversity, equity, and inclusion both in peer review systems and the goals of open science. At times, as noted above, these goals might appear to be in tension with each other - but that should be the start rather than the end of the conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="call-to-action">Call to action&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Each of us plays a part in maintaining or changing the culture of scientific peer review. We invite you to join us to stay updated on activities at
&lt;a href="http://www.reviewerzero.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.reviewerzero.net&lt;/a> and to explore our developing
&lt;a href="https://osf.io/e7z5k/wiki/Resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on-demand resources&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are steps you can take today to move toward a more constructive and equitable peer review system. As with any culture change, shifting a culture requires multiple actors to begin to think and act differently, and cultural change is more possible when actors at different levels of the system take part
&lt;a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?fmR3wF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Hamedani &amp;amp; Markus, 2019)&lt;/a>. If you are someone with power in the system, with experience, and/or with a majority group identity, support minoritized and early career scholars to learn more about the unspoken aspects of peer review. If you have experience in scientific publication, speak about your rejections as well as your successes. When you deliver critique, remember there is a human on the other end of that communication, even if that person is not identified. If there is something promising or exciting about the work, note it explicitly. Recognize what power you have, and amplify the voices and perspectives of people whose voices are not yet central to the conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are someone who has been underserved by the current system, know that there are communities and allies who deeply value your contributions to science. Find friends and mentors who can interpret and contextualize reviews with you. If you encounter hostile or unprofessional reviews, know that you have options (including alerting the editor of the journal), and that unfortunately you are not alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We at Reviewer Zero see equitable practices and reducing group disparities as essential to cultivating excellent science - science that is fair, meaningful, robust, and rigorous. Any move to improve scientific practice can ultimately succeed only if it centers building systems and spaces that represent a diverse range of identities, uphold equitable practices and outcomes, and prioritize inclusivity. Peer review is central to the practice and progress of science, and bettering it to serve a wider range of scientists will improve the rigor, quality, and contribution of science.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Given the scarcity of full-time, permanent academic jobs, more and more PhDs are looking abroad for employment. When I was on the job market in 2020–21, I applied to positions in 7 countries. I landed at the
&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/people/anna.meier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Nottingham&lt;/a> in the UK—which, despite being ostensibly close to my home country of the US in terms of culture and primary language, proved to be
&lt;a href="http://annameier.net/the-big-us-uk-comparison-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an entirely different world&lt;/a>. This was apparent from the job application stage, yet at the time, there was no publicly available guidance on differences between the academic job markets in the US and UK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Earlier this month, I set out to address this. I ran a webinar, “The Academic Job Market: US vs. UK,” aimed at demystifying both markets for applicants. Interest was so great that I added a second installment; in the end, over 200 people registered. You can watch a recording of the webinar below, which will remain freely accessible to all. The slides are also
&lt;a href="http://annameier.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/USUKworkshop.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available to download&lt;/a> from my website. I hope this can be a helpful resource to anyone looking to make sense of different market timelines, varying employment structures, and why you can’t address anyone below the rank of full professor in the UK as “Professor.” (This still trips me up constantly.)&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="structural-factors-shape-employment">Structural Factors Shape Employment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What I’d like to expand on here, however, is something only briefly touched on in the webinar: the structural factors shaping employment in higher education in the US and UK. Whereas much of the academic job market comparison in the two countries is apples and oranges, paying attention to the sociopolitical forces changing higher education reveals much common ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me start with a timely example. In mid-April, faculty (teaching staff in UK parlance), postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and counselors at Rutgers University joined together in unprecedented collective action. In the US, different categories of university staff are represented by different unions, and these are at best loosely networked nationally—there is no equivalent of the University and College Union (UCU), which represents all research and teaching staff, professional services staff, and PhD students at every university in the UK. Yet despite organizational hurdles, some
&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/15/1170284149/rutgers-university-faculty-strike-ends-tentative-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9,000 Rutgers workers&lt;/a> went on strike together for living wages and an end to race and gender pay gaps. I can recall no similar university-wide coordinated action in the US in my lifetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are echoes in this struggle of the dispute UCU has waged since before the pandemic. Wages for UK university staff
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/22/universities-surplus-ucu-union-staff-pay-strikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have fallen some 25%&lt;/a> in real terms since 2009; the
&lt;a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/975/The-diverse-academy---pay-and-employment-of-academic-and-professional-staff-in-UK-HE-by-gender-and-ethnicity-AUT-Oct-05/pdf/diverseacademy_oct05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race and gender pay gaps&lt;/a> remain unacceptable for universities who claim commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI, the UK twist on the US’s DEI: diversity, equity and inclusion). Equally troubling are the echoes in both disputes’ resolutions. The deal at Rutgers, agreed to after a week of action,
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jjjjjjjjohannah/status/1647625266854780928?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been criticized&lt;/a> for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CliffConnolly/status/1647285805658898432?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marginalizing graduate workers’ voices&lt;/a>, just as the current proposal under consideration by UCU provides
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRQJ-7uKjBazxCnxy-tjfXaFExSR779WTIszmXppAivDuoOkYezg7SKZ_jrOrmBT07Dt15n6lvBDSA0/pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no concrete improvements for PhD students&lt;/a> on casualized contracts. Solidarity at Rutgers, as in the UK, has been strongest among the most financially secure staff, with some of the least powerful university employees being left behind. Depending on the discipline, US PhDs will graduate into an academic job market where
&lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/issues/contingency/background-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around 70 percent of jobs&lt;/a> are temporary or contingent—a
&lt;a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/stampout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar landscape&lt;/a> to that facing UK PhDs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="ucu-strike.jpeg" alt="A UCU picket line at the University of Nottingham">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features-not-bugs">Features, Not Bugs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Where do these analogous structural failings come from? The answer to this starts with deconstructing the idea that these are “failings,” rather than intentional components of a system that views degrees as commodities and people as cogs in machines. A system wherein the task of teaching is secondary to that of shoring up a university’s research reputation will not mind if teachers have to

&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/casualised-staff-dehumanised-uk-universities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move from city to city every semester&lt;/a> in search of work. Likewise, a system where

&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-37109-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exploiting their labor&lt;/a> until they burn out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Others have written
&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1478210317719792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more comprehensively&lt;/a> about how these features of higher education (not bugs)
&lt;a href="https://www.boldtypebooks.com/titles/davarian-l-baldwin/in-the-shadow-of-the-ivory-tower/9781568588919/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have become ever more present&lt;/a> in the past few decades. My point is simply that they are unavoidable, regardless of country of residence. Some might claim that coming to the UK will bring reduced research pressures compared to US research-intensive universities, which may be true in terms of the number of publications required but overlooks how the UK’s massive (and growing)
&lt;a href="https://annameier.substack.com/p/grant-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-grubbing apparatus&lt;/a> saps staff time and discourages counterhegemonic work. Others might note that US academic salaries are generally higher than in the UK, which may be true even at poorer institutions but masks the
&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01183-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive (and growing) disparities&lt;/a> across and within US institutions. Regardless, the “it’s better over there” narrative sidesteps the reality of the academic job market for many: that, if they are able, they will go wherever hires them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="labour-situation.jpg" alt="Differences between the UK and US labour situation include differences in pay, job expectations, benefits and industrial relations. The webinar recording provides more information.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trans-national-sharing">Trans-National Sharing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to despair. What’s necessary—and what I hope sharing information across the pond helps encourage, however minimally—is turning collective despair into solidarity. Faculty in the US and UK face different day-to-day pressures, different career benchmarks, and different alphabet soups of acronyms. (Ask me sometime why Master’s students are PGTs but doctoral students are PGRs.) But underneath the surface, our struggles rhyme. It behooves those of us on both sides of the Atlantic to learn about how academia works in the US and UK, as well as in other countries. Our sector is transnational, and transparent, accessible information about that sector is an important foundation from which to exchange expertise, build campaigns, and push for change.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="a-child-of-the-replication-crisis">A child of the replication crisis&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When Open University Press approached me to write a book on the “replication crisis in psychology”, I was filled with excitement as I knew that discussion of replication issues is scarce within teaching and psychology textbooks. If they don’t teach it, then I could! But I also knew it had to be more than the so-called ‘crisis’; a term associated with pessimism. It had to be about how far the discipline of psychology has come, and the opportunities that open research can bring to reform research training and the wider culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a ‘child of the replication crisis’. I completed my PhD in 2016 on &amp;lsquo;stereotype threat&amp;rsquo;; an influential phenomenon that suggests negative societal stereotypes deplete performance. But I got stuck time and time again trying to replicate these classic effects. I felt like a failure. I wish I had known what I know now: that the experiences I was facing were more common than what was gleaned from the published literature. Science is not perfect and nor should it be, but this was not what I was taught through my undergraduate education. So I wrote a book – &lt;em>A Student’s Guide to Open Science&lt;/em> – for my younger self. In other words, for the talented and passionate students studying Psychology. By knowing our history – the good parts but also the messy parts – our students represent the grassroots that can make this discipline the best it can be!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-this-book-about-and-why-is-it-needed">What is this book about and why is it needed?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By now, many researchers have heard about the ‘replication crisis’ that has swept research disciplines, and the fast-paced improvements brought about by open research reform. However, there is still a gap in educational practices – in the teaching of the replication crisis – which FORRT and its members strive to overcome. Furthermore, when trying to learn about the replication crisis and open science, it can feel overwhelming and there are lots of different resources in many different places. With this in mind, I wrote a “&lt;em>A Student’s Guide to Open Science&lt;/em>” as a way of pulling together all of these various pieces of information and useful resources that are currently out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book walks students (and their educators) through a recent history of the replication crisis in psychology, the causes and drivers of crises (including academic incentive structures, questionable research practices, and cognitive biases), and open science reform, its benefits and associated challenges. Importantly, to ensure that students understand how to put these new practices into practice, it also includes a handy, digestible guide to implementing open science practices such as preprints, preregistration, Registered Reports, and open materials, data, and code. It is my hope that this book becomes an essential guide to navigating the replication crisis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pedagogic-resources-within-the-book">Pedagogic resources within the book&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This book is primarily aimed at students studying psychology at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, but throughout I include useful pedagogic resources that educators can use to teach the replication crisis and open science reform. For example, there is an activity where students plan to replicate a study and can understand the various difficulties they may stumble upon in their quest. Here, they find their favourite article from the journal it was published and walk themselves through different questions to assess whether there is enough information to perform an exact replication – what is the aim of the study? Do the researchers specify their main hypotheses? What is the research design? Are the measures they used detailed enough to understand how they were scored? Do they report whether (and how) they screened or cleaned their data? (see Box 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Box 1. The seat of a replicator. An example pedagogic activity from “A Student’s Guide to Open Science”.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="seat-of-a-replicator.png" alt="The seat of a replicator is a pedagogic activity which asks students to plan an exact replication of their favourite journal article. It set out a number of questions they need to ask about the study, such as &amp;ldquo;what is the sample size? Are there any inclusion or exclusion criteria?&amp;rdquo; The learning outcomes of this activity are: To know the difference between an exact and conceptual replication. To understand how to conduct an independent replication. To identify challenges when replicating published research. To understand the importance of transparent reporting to aid replications.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This same pedagogic activity can then be expanded to teach about open science reform. Specifically, using the notes that students have taken from their “seat of a replicator activity”, they can then have a go at preregistering their replication using a template from a verified repository (e.g., AsPredicted.org/Open Science Framework). These templates can be downloaded from each repository and students can either complete these as a formative (e.g., seminar activity) or summative assessment (e.g., written report; see Box 2).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Box 2. Pedagogic activity: preregistering a replication study.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="aspredicted-template.png" alt="This activity asks students to write a preregistration for a replication study, using the As Predicted dot org template. The learning outcomes for this are: To understand how to transparently plan a study. To demonstrate understanding of how open science practices can aid transparency, replication, and reproducibility. To interpret research articles and apply this learning to conducting independent research studies.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to these pedagogic resources, the book also contains top tips for implementing open science practices into student’s research training, including for preprints, preregistration, Registered Reports, and open materials, data, and code. Whilst the focus is mainly on quantitative research, it also provides links and resources to qualitative research. In addition, throughout it discusses the many different organisations and initiatives that have shaped my own learning of open science (see Box 3), thus providing a detailed overview of everything we have learnt so far from the advent of the replication crisis through to current open science reform.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Nowhere Lab &amp;amp; FORRT&lt;/strong>.
Nowhere Lab has partnered with FORRT as part of FORRT’s efforts to promote social justice and enable equality of access to open scholarship training! Nowhere Lab members benefit from weekly meetings where they can bring any questions they have about adopting any open scholarship practices (or anything else related to science and/or academia). Dr. Priya Silverstein (Nowhere Lab founder) is also available to answer any questions about engaging in other FORRT initiatives either during the weekly meetings, by reaching out via the Nowhere Lab or FORRT Slack workspaces, or by email. Nowhere Lab also operates informal mentorship – rather than matching mentors and mentees, people with mutual interests and skills are able to be connected and there are several channels in our Slack for seeking help or support for a variety of issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout my academic career, I loved being in a lab. I looked forward to biweekly lab meetings as a research assistant, hearing about what the Ph.D. students were up to and wondering about what my own Ph.D. would hold (if I ever got that far). When I finally got a Ph.D. position, I had not one but TWO weekly lab meetings with each of my two supervisors. In the first, we always held journal clubs – taking some of the newest and most exciting developmental science research and dissecting the theory and methods to bits. In the second, we had a mix of journal clubs, presentations, and catch-ups. A Ph.D. can be quite lonely – just you and your super-specific topic – so lab meetings were a welcome time to reflect, process, and think with labmates. During a pandemic-induced furlough from my postdoc, and when I took two alt-academic jobs after this, I really missed this chance to connect with labmates. So, I decided to create my own lab. That’s where Nowhere Lab began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Who we are&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowhere Lab (
&lt;a href="http://nowherelab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://nowherelab.com/&lt;/a>) is an online community for people who would like the lab meeting experience but don’t currently have one. We have members from across all populated continents and career stages: undergraduate students, master&amp;rsquo;s students, Ph.D. students, postdocs, faculty members, and people working outside of academia. We hold weekly meetings and have an active Slack (
&lt;a href="https://join.slack.com/t/nowherelab/shared_invite/zt-1b9ky398h-z5QaNohPP613EBX~zpXQFw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been a humbling and often emotional experience to hear the stories of those who have joined Nowhere Lab. Some members have joined when caught at a difficult and awkward time where they don’t feel embedded within their Ph.D. lab (e.g. they’re currently writing up) but also don’t have a new lab. Some members have joined when they get their first faculty job and don’t have any students for their lab yet. Some members have recently left academia and have mixed emotions about this transition. Some have joined because they’re considering postgraduate research but have never had any experience of research due to educational priorities in their country. One member even joined because health issues meant they weren’t able to take on new students and thus no longer had their own lab. We’re a home for the lost and are brought closer together by the stories of why we need Nowhere Lab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What we do&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we do weekly is entirely dictated by members and has included job interview prep, advice on ongoing projects, discussions, statistical training, journal clubs, and much more. For example, we often have conversations where people who have done a Ph.D. share advice with members who are considering one. We decided to share this advice openly in a
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dsb8VzoP8HfaYy_oherlqP3qOqr0xHoqvYwnAqlbtts/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ph.D. survival guide&lt;/a>, in the hope that it will help people who are considering embarking on a Ph.D. or have just started. This guide covers things to know about doing a Ph.D., what’s great and not great about doing one, top tips, how to choose between two programmes, what to do when you think you’ve made the wrong choice, signs of a toxic environment, and how (not) to handle stress. As well as being useful, creating this guide was also a cathartic process for some members who had less than ideal Ph.D. experiences and wanted to share things they wished they’d known at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our goals&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowhere Lab aims to open science up to anyone and everyone. For example, we have members who work in tech and nonprofits who would not normally consider themselves scientists or get to engage in a scientific community. In addition to advancing diversity as an essential part of open science, we often focus explicitly on methods-based open science skills and knowledge advancement too. For example, we often read papers on open science and metascience in our journal clubs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Achievements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the Ph.D. survival guide is Nowhere Lab’s first “output”, we have many other success stories that have come from the lab. We have now had several Ph.D. vivas and graduations – we even got to virtually attend one member’s viva which was really interesting for members who’d never seen one before. Careers have been changed – one member got a job from a Nowhere Lab referral, and two members were offered jobs after doing interview prep with the lab. And friendships have been forged – one member even visited me and stayed at my home!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Join us&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many reasons why someone might want to join Nowhere Lab:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>New faculty who have no one in their lab yet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ex-academics who now work in industry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keen undergraduates and masters students&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freelance sci-commers/consultants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People who are in a toxic lab&lt;/li>
&lt;li>People between jobs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>…and many many more!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="five-lessons-from-a-non-academic-job">Five lessons from a non-academic job&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It’s been one year after &lt;strong>leaving academia&lt;/strong> and starting to work for a charity organisation. For a bit of context, I did my PhD in Psychology, after which I spent four years across two postdocs (one in France, one in England) and I got to the point where I could no longer see my career progress in academia. There are many reasons why I came to this crossroad, but above all, I realised that my passion is with research and data, and less so with the other aspects of academic life. &lt;strong>To my delight, my non-academic journey&lt;/strong> so far has been full of development and challenges and here are some of the lessons I shared, with some additional thoughts. Here are five things I learnt:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The three &lt;em>data&lt;/em> lessons&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I learnt a lot about data. Real life data is messy AF. I learnt how to join complicated datasets with missing data and how to deal with types of variables I rarely encountered like strings and dates. I cannot underestimate how neat data from academic research is compared to what real life data looks like.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I learnt how organisations store their data. Unlike any other datasets I worked with before, organisational data is dynamic. There isn&amp;rsquo;t just one database but rather multiple sets that are related to one another. You need tools like SQL to pull data from internal data systems. SQL queries are also used to power live dashboards which are used to display data in the simplest form. This is where most teams take their data from. Tools like PowerBi and Tableau are the major players here when it comes to data visualisation and internal data sharing. This was a completely new lesson to me because like most academics, I have been used to dealing with only static data, pulled from Qualtrics or arranged neatly within one Excel sheet. The good news about SQL is that I was able to pick it up relatively easily with my programming skills in R but what I still find tricky is finding the piece of data I need in columns and columns of data that aren’t always neatly labelled. I really miss having a neat codebook with all variable names listed!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I also had to revisit my thoughts on descriptive statistics. In academia, inferential stats are king because we infer something about a population from a sample. With organisational data, you have access to the whole population so descriptive stats become very powerful. I had to resist an urge to ask “yes, but is this increase statistically significant?” because if all 100 programme members answered the same question about the satisfaction in the following year, and we saw an increase of 5% in satisfaction, this in itself is informational and quantified in terms of the effect size - we don’t need inferential statistics to tell us if this difference was significant at the 0.01 level or at the 0.001 level and whether this would apply to the wider population - this isn’t the point.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The two (new) &lt;em>methodological approaches&lt;/em> lessons.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>I learnt about quasi-experimental approaches using matching. While in academia I often ran experiments, establishing causation to evidence the impact of established programmes and interventions is more tricky as you often can&amp;rsquo;t randomly assign participants to treatment and control. This led me to learning about quasi-experimental statistical approaches and methods like propensity score matching to estimate the likelihood of treatment and select the ideal matched pairs. Lack of random assignment is also the least of all issues. The environment in which programmes and interventions happen in the real world is far from the controlled experiments we run in labs/online. So how do you assess whether participating in a long-term teacher training programme has a real life impact for the pupils they teach? How do you establish causation and the process by which it happens? These are a lot more tricky questions than I ever thought I had to approach. It turns out there is a whole host of methodologies to address this issue - these are a lot more prevalent approaches in disciplines such as policy (think: policymakers often want to know what impact introducing policy X had on the local population but they aren’t always able to randomly assign two groups of population into an intervention with policy application versus not).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I learnt how to run a discrete choice experiment. This is a method that is often employed in marketing, I&amp;rsquo;ve rarely heard of it before but I found an excellent application of this method in the work we were doing. By designing a discrete choice experiment, we were able to assess what changes we could make to programmes we offer to increase their propensity. Would this programme be more popular if we introduced element X or increased Y? This technique looks at implicit preferences for various factors (not just two factors but many at the same time). It puts them directly in competition with one another to calculate propensity of each factor. It&amp;rsquo;s also often used in medical sciences and economics.I had a lot of fun designing this research and I am currently working with internal stakeholders to develop actions from this research - how can we turn this knowledge to attract more people to our programmes? It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating how quickly you can turn research into action.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I find the process of reflecting on these lessons somewhat therapeutic because this time last year, I was full of excitement but also filled with some worries as I was embarking on my non-academic path. These lessons tell me that I not only was able to build on my research and data skills that I developed during my academic career, but also this move has allowed me to expand my development in ways I didn’t anticipate before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I originally went into academia because I loved this process of learning and developing, stumbling across new challenges and new approaches, but after 7 years I started getting worn out by discussing the same issues while using the same approaches and I craved new challenges. This first year of the non-academic pathway has certainly fulfilled that goal. I’m not saying that academia can’t be a fulfilling path with lots of challenges - I think it’s more about the fit. &lt;strong>Digging deeper into what it is really about your job that makes you happy is going to lead you down the right pathways, academic or not.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-four-grand-challenges-identified-by-aps-members">What are the four grand challenges identified by APS members?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-globalization-and-diversity">1. Globalization and diversity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Psychological science has been repeatedly described as WEIRD, meaning Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic. In particular, the persistent use of predominately White and North American college students to study human behaviour has raised concerns about the generalizability of our findings, as well as our legitimacy as a science (Arnett, 2008; Henrich, Heine, &amp;amp; Norenzayan, 2010; IJzerman et al., 2021; Thalmayer et al., 2021; Tindle, 2021). Others argue that we should get rid of the dichotomy altogether (Ghai, 2021).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s what you can do to enhance globalization and diversity within psychological science:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Invite international speakers to participate in opportunities that historically privilege U.S. citizens (e.g., colloquium series, workshops, awards, fellowships)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explicitly cite the achievements and ideas of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color within undergraduate and postgraduate courses, particularly Black women (e.g., see existing resources such as the
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7Eacoyv9VVg2lBbCV-KJZg4nSGvR_VZFOysOyOGG8g/edit#gid=666010790" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIPOC-authored Psychology Papers spreadsheet&lt;/a> for a detailed list of available scholarship; reference Smith, et al., 2021 for a description of the
&lt;a href="https://www.citeblackwomencollective.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cite Black Women campaign&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Encourage people to engage with marginalized groups, including Disabled people; reference Educator’s Corner on
&lt;a href="https://forrt.org/educators-corner/010-neurodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigating Open scholarship for neurodivergent researchers&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acknowledge your positionality, meaning the social-historical-political aspects of a researcher that influence your orientations (see Bourke, 2014; Secules, et al., 2021) and include reflexive practice for all research pursuits, including quantitative research programmes (see Jamieson, Pownall, &amp;amp; Govaart, 2022)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consider context and identity by reporting sample demographics (Sabik, et al., 2020), as well as incorporating informed frameworks (e.g., interpret results via critical race theory or open scholarship)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="2-research-integrity-and-applicability">2. Research integrity and applicability&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many of us have been warned about the replication crisis in psychology (also commonly referred to as the replicability or reproducibility crisis, as well as the credibility revolution). Not unique to psychology, the crisis highlights that the results of many peer-reviewed scientific studies are either difficult or impossible to replicate (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). However, the legitimacy of the concern with regards to replication remains hotly contested (Feest, 2019; Maxwell, et al., 2015).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s what you can do to promote research integrity and applicability within psychological science:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Challenge bias against open science as valuable or legitimate; incentivize early career and contingent scientists to participate by reshaping institutional norms or program milestones (e.g., encouraging students to pre-register dissertation studies; Bahlai, et al., 2019)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shift mentality to encourage collaboration rather than competition (e.g., scientists working across departments or multiple working groups rather than in a singular lab at a particular campus)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raise awareness about the unique experiences of intersectionally invisible participants (e.g., people who share two or more marginalized identities such as Black women; Coles &amp;amp; Pasek, 2020; Purdie-Vaughns &amp;amp; Eibach, 2008)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use existing resources, such as
&lt;a href="https://osf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Open Science Framework&lt;/a> or
&lt;a href="http://aspredicted.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aspredicted.org&lt;/a> to collaborate, document, archive, share and register research projects, materials, code, and data; join the
&lt;a href="https://psysciacc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychological Science Accelerator&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-collaboration-across-fields-and-disciplines">3. Collaboration across fields and disciplines&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As psychologists, we rarely cross borders, whether real or imagined (e.g., departments, universities, countries)! Collaboration across disciplines and fields, however, is extremely beneficial to psychological scientists seeking to identify connections between psychological processes, history, and broader context (2020). Take, for instance, work from Henderson and colleagues on Confederate monuments; they find that the number of lynching victims in a county is a positive and significant predictor of Confederate memorialization in that county (2021). An intersectional lens can be applied to their findings to illustrate how race and social forces such as the Civil War contributed to anti-Black racism in the U.S., particularly during Reconstruction in the South. Through this example, we can also see how the present work invites participation from other fields like American politics, history, and Africana studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s what you can do to collaborate across fields and disciplines within psychological science:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Participate in scholarly events outside of psychology, such as the
&lt;a href="https://minoritypolitics.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minority Politics Online Seminar Series&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Invite speakers from other disciplines to department- or University-led symposiums or conferences; provide remote options for attendance and accessibility grants to stimulate broader participation (e.g., the
&lt;a href="https://uva.theopenscholar.com/diversifyingscholarship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Virginia Diversifying Scholarship Conference&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Initiate cross-discipline collaborations (e.g.,
&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/11/3/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaither &amp;amp; Sims, 2022&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leverage existing networks such as Academic Twitter to incorporate the views of people from relevant disciplines and achieve shared goals (e.g., a systematic co-creation of new knowledge on a specific topic)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="4-strengthening-theory">4. Strengthening theory&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In science, a theory is a well-supported explanation of natural phenomena, confirmed repeatedly through observation and experimentation. Theory changes, however, if and when evidence accumulates that the theory cannot explain. Adaptive research in psychology must therefore follow the assumption that our knowledge will expand along with our understanding of human diversity (and vice versa). Doing so will allow room for concepts such as intersectionality and open science to be integrated within psychological science. Take, for instance, Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory. Frustrated with the centrality of white boys, Stern and colleagues developed a new version centered on Black girls (2021). You can see the model here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="image.png" alt="Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory" title="Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s what you can do to strengthen theory within psychological science:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Expand theory regarding the mind and behavior to represent human diversity; the development of reliable theories is essential to scientific progress (&lt;em>see&lt;/em> Eronen &amp;amp; Bringmann, 2021 for insights into developing good psychological theories)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compile evidence to advance new theories if and when they are no longer applicable or outdated due to history or context (e.g., COVID-19); create theories that center marginalized people and the real-world scenarios they experience in day-to-day life, controlling for relevant covariates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Join me!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible that I am overoptimistic about the future of psychological science or naive to the systematic obstacles that must be overcome. Still, I would rather be naive than conform to a system that is stagnant to change. When we stand outside the Ivory Tower, aware that the system is corrupt but alone, helpless, and discouraged, we know that the master&amp;rsquo;s tools will never dismantle the master&amp;rsquo;s house (Lorde, 2018). We were meant to be kept out of the house. Ergo, the time has come to build a house of our own, a house founded on principles that reflect and affirm our identities as the marginalized, unconventional, and historically excluded. It is within our avant-garde that we will find our true power, and grapple with the many challenges requiring redress to create a stronger, more robust science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Here’s what you can do:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="who-we-are-and-why-is-this-important">Who we are and why is this important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In academia, there has been much discussion about how open scholarship can benefit marginalised voices (e.g. Robertson, 2020; Pownall et al., 2020). However, neurodivergent individuals (e.g. dyslexic, autistic, ADHD) have received little attention. According to the
&lt;a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Higher Education Statistics Agency&lt;/a>, only 2.2% in 2003/04, 3.9% in 2012/13 to 5.5% in 2019/2020 of staff at universities in the UK disclosed having a physical or neurological disability. However, the true figures are likely to be higher. Despite increased coverage and interest regarding disability issues in academia, concerns regarding negative perceptions of disability disclosure remain. More open discussions are taking place about the lived experiences of disabilities and chronic illnesses, as people with disability are becoming less stigmatised, leading to more disclosures being discussed. However, there is still a question being asked: ‘where are the disabled academics?’ (We are here but you don’t see us!).&lt;/p>
&lt;br>

&lt;/div>
&lt;br>
&lt;p>Disability? How do you have a disability? You do not have a deficit with your body, you can still function in society, earn a living and participate in community life. Disability is portrayed as a personal tragedy, with some heroic individuals “overcoming” their terrible handicap. So how are you disabled? The answer is that not all disabilities are visible. The relative proportion of disabled academics is widely underestimated (e.g. Farahar, 2021), likely due to the stigma attached to the concept of disability (Mellifont, 2021). In addition, there are too many assumptions about disability being a physical or intellectual impairment with no discussion on difficulties regarding cognition and mental health. This discussion also fails to encapsulate that the range of difficulties people face may be connected to an individual’s neurodevelopmental characteristics (Singer, 2017). This is in spite of the fact that there are conditions that are described by psychologists as disabling but people with these conditions are treated as if they are not disabled. This is the ‘neurodiverse’ group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neurodiversity is the non-pathological variation in the human brain regarding sociability, learning, attention, mood and other mental functions at a group level (Singer, 2017). An individual is neurodivergent if their neurology diverges from that of the neurological majority. Neurodiversity is critically relevant to the social sciences as it discusses the diverse cognitive behaviours forming the foundations of what it means to be unique and human. Importantly, the neurodiversity movement questions the assumption that all humans must conform to the same expectations in order to flourish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="fig1.png" alt="Neurodiversity" title="Neurodiversity">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you may still be wondering how neurodivergent individuals are disabled? The labelling of disability is a personal matter. It depends on what models we use to interpret it. Under the medical model, disability is portrayed as a flaw, weakness or a biological limitation of the individual. Put simply, it is a personal tragedy that was inflicted on you. Disability under the social theory of disability is defined not as a personal tragedy but as the result of barriers – environmental and social practices that disable, as opposed to enabling, the individual. In addition, the social model makes the distinction that an impairment is a property of an individual body, while disability is a social process. However, it is important to remember that both models are not mutually exclusive, but are required to be used together to open a constructive dialogue between able-bodied and disabled individuals, even among disabled individuals. The important message is that disabilities are &lt;strong>dynamic&lt;/strong> and reasonable adjustments should be made for all groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In today’s academic environment, the economic and political system of universities, among many other industries, focus on productivity and profit. As a result, measures that focus on productivity and profit such as standards, norms, league tables, achievements and publications are becoming more and more important. Health and wellbeing and slow science are becoming less important, despite the fact that slow science and resting are important for creativity, critical thinking and understanding data, three crucial components to help accumulate knowledge. As a result of this development, burnout becomes more common and this is more prevalent among people with disabilities (Burns et al., 2021).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People with disabilities are more likely to be excluded from the academic workforce with its demands for speed, efficiency and productivity, leading to normalised, ingrained and internalised ableism to an extent that they desire to be able-bodied. As a result of this exclusion, able-bodied individuals may believe that disabled individuals do not contribute to the productivity of the community and argue that their unemployment is the ‘fate of the idle’ (Singer, 2017). This means that in academia and industry, people with disabilities become oppressed, mocked, ridiculed and perceived as a nuisance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many gatekeepers determine whether an individual is neurodivergent and these processes are driven by individuals who are neurotypical. As a result, referral time for these services vary widely, from 4 weeks to 201 weeks within the UK (Lloyd, 2019) and if a person does not fit the criteria, the individual can be ignored and may not receive the much-needed help that they require. This can lead to poor self-esteem, unemployment (e.g. around 22% in autistic people are in any type of employment; see Figure 2 in
&lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/outcomesfordisabledpeopleintheuk/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fact sheet&lt;/a>). As a result, neurodivergent individuals may blame themselves for the difficulties they encounter, as opposed to the barriers that society has placed on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite this, people of different neurodivergent conditions or families of the people with the conditions have begun meeting and talking to each other about their experiences and one common shared experience is a history of misinterpretation and mistreatment by the dominant neurotypical cultures and its institutions such as academia. As a result of centuries of oppression of disabled people worldwide and a hyper-normalised environment, in addition to seeing the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus pandemic on disabled students (see this amazing
&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-021-10559-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper &lt;/a>by Dr Joanna Zawadka), many neurodivergent and disabled staff feel discouraged in an environment that should aim to support them. They do not feel like they belong, their differences are seen as an impairment and their voice does not seem to matter. They do not see themselves represented in psychological science, academia, business, teaching or elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are a group of early-career neurotypical and neurodivergent researchers that are a part of the Framework of Open Reproducible Research and Training (FORRT) community, aiming to make academia and the open scholarship community more open to neurodiversity. Everyone, no matter what they identify with, is welcome in this group. We aim to discuss how open scholarship can be intersected with the neurodiversity movement, and emphasise how differences should be highlighted and accepted, whilst supporting the idea of accessibility. Our neurodiversity team is a group that currently consists of individuals that have autism, dyspraxia/DCD, speech-language differences, ADHD, dyslexia, or are neurotypical allies. If you have these or other neurominorities and wish to be part of the team, you are more than welcome to join!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-do-we-want">What do we want?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We want academia and open scholarship not to be covertly homophobic, racist, sexist and ableist. However, by attempting to adapt and work within the existing defined rules of academia and its power structures, what we do is reinforce that system, irrespective of intentions. Lorde (2018) illustrates this well in the metaphor: the master’s tools (i.e. the dynamics, language, and conceptual framework that create and maintain social inequities) never serve to dismantle the master’s house, but somehow end up building another extension of that mansion. Similarly, the fundamental assumption under the medical model of disability serves to both disempower the individual and strengthen societal perception that the neurodivergent person is the problem. Thus, we need lasting, sustainable, and widespread empowerment that can be obtained by making and propagating the shift from the medical to the social model, or use both in order to encourage a constructive dialogue. Put simply, in order to fulfil our potential, we as neurodivergent people cannot say that there is something wrong with us, and we must use the tools of the social model to temper or remove barriers provided by the medical model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Feminist Standpoint theory (Harding, 1992; Pohlhaus, 2002), it is important that we empower under-represented and marginalised voices in knowledge production, and draw upon the lived experience when designing for under-represented voices. However, this is not possible, as we still follow psychology&amp;rsquo;s positivist (i.e., all authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge) tradition; this assumes that there is a fundamental truth of human diversity and that scientists should be objective. However, the research conducted on neurominorities is marred by the fact scientists are like everyone else. We are humans with different political views and lived experiences as well as biases (e.g. confirmation bias), which affect the questions that are asked and influence researchers’ degrees of freedom. Therefore, studies into neurodiversity are undertaken within structures that are characterised by power relationships, where colour, gender and neurological makeup are in no way neutral. This leads to neurodivergent individuals being treated as an _object _of the conversation, rather than the &lt;em>subject&lt;/em>. This is analogous to the way the Eastern Societies and their members were treated by Western Researchers in the mid and late 20th Century (see Said&amp;rsquo;s Orientalism for further discussion; Said, 1976). &amp;ldquo;The Orient&amp;rdquo; was othered, misunderstood and seen as inferior, which led to a very skewed depiction which reflected Western biases. In post-colonial times, our awareness of power relations is, at least in some academic publications, greater than before. However, in the case of neurodiversity, there has been little change as most studies in the area are still conducted by those in possession of greater social power, with little input from neurodivergent researchers. This approach is not only patronising, but very dangerous as it will take centuries to counteract the discrimination it produces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The power structure that dominates psychology and social sciences is from white, male and able-bodied people who treat neurodivergent people as an &lt;em>object&lt;/em> of the conversation, not the &lt;em>subject&lt;/em>. As argued by Jackson (1998, p.8), &amp;ldquo;Each person is at once a subject for himself or herself - a _who _- and an object for others - a &lt;em>what&lt;/em>. And though individuals speak, act, and work toward belonging to a world of others, they simultaneously strive to experience themselves as world makers&amp;rdquo;. Once we consider that scientists are human, and neurodivergent people can be included in this research, then we can co-create projects that allow us to discover the truth about diversity from different perspectives. This is more commonly discussed in qualitative research but rarely even considered in quantitative research. In addition, with different perspectives, there is an emphasis on moving away from the typical White, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) samples that account for 80% of study samples but only 12% of the world population, despite the fact that this movement does not acknowledge the neurodiversity movement or neurominorities (e.g. autistic, ADHD, dyslexic). In addition, there is a lack of patient involvement in how to make the research more likely to improve the quality of life of neurodivergent people. The need to address this issue and to ensure disabled and marginalised individuals are directly included in research and policy-making decisions that affect them can be expressed by the commonly used slogan “Nothing about us without us”. Emancipatory and/or participatory approaches such as participatory action research (e.g. Bertilsdotter-Rosqvist et al., 2019; Fletcher-Watson et al., 2018; Grant &amp;amp; Kara, 2021; Leadbitter et al., 2021; Strang et al., 2019; Strang et al., 2021) have considerable potential for facilitating this type of collective knowledge creation and driving social change that benefits neurodivergent people in areas that may contrast with many mainstream research approaches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A recent movement has become important in education: open scholarship. This reflects the idea that knowledge of all kinds should be openly shared, transparent, rigorous, reproducible, replicable, accumulative, and inclusive (allowing for all knowledge systems). Open scholarship includes all activities that are not solely limited to research such as teaching and pedagogy. One key foundation of open scholarship is accessibility, a key facet that also belongs to the neurodiverse movement (e.g. Brown &amp;amp; Leigh, 2018; Brown et al., 2018). Accessibility and inclusion is where your content, activities and all their components are accessible to all people with disabilities, learning differences, mental health conditions or other health conditions that may affect their learning or engagement with the materials and activities, research activities, clinical training, and teaching (Victor et al., 2021a). It highlights the importance of embracing diversity and making everyone feel welcome and valued (see
&lt;a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/digital-education/inclusion/neurodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information sheet&lt;/a>). Discussions have been, however, scarce regarding not only how open scholarship can advance the neurodiverse movement, but also how it can benefit from it. It is thus a priority to build community to discuss how the neurodiversity movement can be included in open scholarship, as the lived experience of neurodivergent individuals (including encountered barriers) may help to enhance accessibility, allowing open scholarship to be truly open (Whitaker &amp;amp; Guest, 2020). This in turn may help to dismantle the harmful stereotypes about disabled individuals (Devendorf et al., 2021), providing more specific provisions for neurodivergent and/or disabled researchers (e.g. virtual conferences; see Levitis et al., 2021). Furthermore, including this population in academia will help promote work-life balance, by denormalising overwork and practices that lead to burnout.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been a recent shift towards the use of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) (i.e., an approach to teaching highlighting that academics/tutors should be proactively, not reactively, inclusive by making adjustments to their teaching without students having to disclose their disability to student disability services) in higher education (Burgstahler &amp;amp; Cory, 2010). UDL has several benefits: by offering a more flexible and inclusive practice, there is no need to disclose one’s disability, irrespective of student status (Clouder et al., 2020). In addition, making the assumption about the student’s intention based on your interpretation of their behaviour can be damaging for neurodivergent students’ self-esteem. University staff should recognise the different manners in which students may communicate and contribute, whilst being open to collaborating with students to find suitable approaches. Put simply, it can be described as neurodiversity involvement for pedagogy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, UDL allows students to engage in the material that best suits their learning. Traditionally, university students are assessed through essays/ dissertations, group/individual presentations or examinations with very little discussion but neurodivergent students may find these types of assignments challenging that otherwise may succeed. UDL encourages educators to examine the students’ strengths, as opposed to weaknesses and allows students to have more choice. Learners could do a recorded presentation, as opposed to presenting in a group or present the skills they have acquired on the course in a different form that may suit them better. This would benefit the students in terms of better preparation for employment, by focusing on the student’s ability and professional values, as opposed to the challenges. This approach is also fully aligned with the UK Professional Standards Framework in Higher Education (UKPSF) as it facilitates educators' continuous development (A5), focuses on respecting individual learners and diverse learning communities (V1), promotes participation in higher education and equality of opportunity for learners (V2) and acknowledges the wider context in which higher education operates recognising the implications for recognising the implications for professional practice (V4). Another example is that attendance should not be used as a marker of class engagement, as there are several variables that predict class attendance (e.g. keeping pace with other students, attentional demands, and attendance being socially impossible). At the start of class, educators should signpost the expected outline and inform students before an activity is finished or changed. This lack of physical attendance and/or inability to follow attentional cues is not evidence of a lack of engagement but that students may engage in ways that are not expected and we should meet them where they are now, as opposed to where we expect them to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important core property of UDL is to provide choice to allow students to develop agency in their own learning. Lecturers may feel that academic standards will not be maintained or students will not learn the learning outcomes but this choice aims to remove structural barriers that are faced when perhaps making a specific activity unnecessarily difficult, as opposed to reducing the academic level. For instance, lecture capture allows the student to learn in an environment that suits them and to learn at their own pace. Over decades, lecturers have questioned the effectiveness of lecture capture (Nordmann et al., 2021), but students such as dyslexic students, who otherwise struggled, may engage with learning and develop at their own speed (Nightingale et al., 2019). Rather than develop concerns on whether students will continue to engage, UDL offers students an opportunity to develop agency in their learning, a goal that lecturers should encourage. And applied more broadly to the academic employees’ relationships, UDL can also improve the academic culture, providing academic workers with opportunities to engage in their trade in a way that fits their neurocognitive style. Last but not least, UDL promotes and facilitates social justice and equality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we want academia to approach neurodiversity in the same way that true cosmopolitans approach cultural diversity. We want academics to reject the idea that the lived experiences of neurominorities such as dyslexia, autism, ADHD, which differs from the neuromajority, should be pathologised. Rather, these experiences should be accepted as fundamental to the human experience, to allow us to have different perspectives to understand what it means to be human. As a result, by considering this perspective, ‘‘our strengths and deficits will shape, not deny, our humanity’ (Grinker, 2010, p.173).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put simply, our team wants people in academia and the open scholarship community to understand that: “Being disabled does not make a person any less of a scientist. Actively listen to your students and/or peers if they disclose their disabilities, as they have entrusted you with sharing this important part about themselves. **If you are in a position of power and a disabled person asks for accommodations, give it to them. **Learn to recognise that disabilities are unique and dynamic. Ultimately, we should strive for universal design, of both our workspaces and pedagogy, as this gives everybody the best chance to fully be themselves and blossom in science” (
&lt;a href="https://ecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/disability-pride-month-at-communications-biology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middleton, 2021&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-plans">Our plans&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our overall aims are to: reduce the stigma neurodivergent individuals face by raising awareness of the contributions neurodivergent researchers have made, encourage neurodivergent researchers that there is no need to mask or hide our differences, and show that neurodiversity is an asset to open scholarship and academia. Open scholarship, like psychological science, benefits from neurodiversity and disabled perspectives, which have been growing in the past decade (e.g. Chown et al., 2017; Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2017; Grant &amp;amp; Kara, 2021; Kapp, 2020).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, we are in the initial stages of creating a database of papers written by neurodivergent researchers. This will be a comprehensive crowd-sourced database of research written by neurodivergent researchers with the aim to allow educators to diversify their syllabi to include neurodivergent researchers to help counteract the bias towards able-bodied researchers. This database will help students feel that they can belong in academia, and that neurodivergent or disabled people can have some important strengths in research contexts (Grant &amp;amp; Kara, 2021). This project aims to be a “living“ resource, which will be regularly updated to include new studies authored by neurodivergent researchers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, we will engender a survey which will be similar to Victor et al. (2021b) and Devendorf et al. (2021). Their surveys investigated prevalence of lived experience, discussed the lived experiences and stigma (e.g. attitudes towards self-relevant research, help-seeking, disclosure) of mental health challenges among applied psychology researchers. The neurodiversity survey will detail the proportion of neurodivergent students and researchers (e.g. undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers) from different countries and different disciplines. It will investigate experiences in academia, possible concerns and barriers (e.g. external stigma, self stigma and difficulties in help-seeking) of neurodivergent students and researchers. In addition, we will discuss attitudes towards the neurodiversity movement, open scholarship, and the intersectionality between neurodiversity and open scholarship. We believe our work will improve neurodiverse representation and awareness. More importantly, we hope our work will also promote the inclusion of neurodiversity within the scientific community and the next generation of neurodivergent scientists. By including a neurodiverse population, “we have a huge opportunity to not only advance our science but also to equitably serve all of humanity” (Ghai, 2021, p2). Thus, we can encourage ourselves to broaden our minds and to truly be “open” in open scholarship.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we are also currently planning a manuscript that will take the form of a position statement, detailing how neurodiversity and open scholarship can benefit from each other. With these additional resources to combat the biases, prejudices and misconceptions of disability, you may be surprised what we can bring to the table and we hope these resources can enable us to do just that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="join-us">Join us!&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We need to discuss the challenges faced by neurodivergent people, so they can feel seen. It is a wonderful experience to be seen and heard. We feel sad that not all neurodivergent people will encounter the same privileges that we have encountered. They feel these things so hard and this impacts their mental health, and in turn, leads to very upsetting ends. Neurodivergent people have been marginalised in so many ways that we have missed so many opportunities to make their lives that much better. We cannot change what has happened in the past; however, we hope that the resources we create will help improve representation early in students’ careers, so then they can hold their head high and smile, knowing they do not need to mask anymore. Also, they can feel proud that they can be themselves, achieve things with the correct reasonable adjustments and be treated as an equal, not an inferior. Put simply, we would like ally neurotypical academics of the neurodiverse movement and disabled academics to
&lt;a href="https://forrt.org/about/get-involved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join us&lt;/a> at FORRT, so we can provide &amp;ldquo;more effective support…[including] specific provisions for disabled researchers, online conferences and the ability to work from home&amp;rdquo; (Niedernhuber et al., 2021 p.34). These provisions need to continue post-COVID-19 pandemic because we cannot return back to normalcy. Not because it is not possible, but because the conversation about disability, race and gender has truly started and we are not letting this conversation end until everyone feels included in their environment. We want everyone not to just survive, but to thrive and flourish in their respective environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="history-of-team-neurodiversity">History of Team-Neurodiversity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This project began on the 24th June 2021 meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science in a roundtable discussion,
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSGIkhtdNoTURaeCkpCWrVS64md_U2cCXNape5nAa1cZOuz1vKGg66wblntTSiH6JtuS6FXDiu9PFm0/pub#id.jjj4ixyqr7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“How can open scholarship support evidence-based learning in people with neurodiverse conditions?”&lt;/a> led by Dr. Tamara Kalandaze and Dr. Mahmoud Elsherif. During this roundtable discussion, Dr. Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe attended this discussion. As a result of a fruitful discussion, an initial framework was developed that led to a discussion about how open scholarship and neurodiversity intersect, and on the 28th of June 2021, Team Neurodiversity was created. However, Team Neurodiversity did not have a home to discuss open scholarship and neurodiversity topics. The Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) kindly offered us a base so we could establish ourselves and become a tour de force in this area. Although it started with five members, it has grown to a smashing total of 56 members based in more than 8 countries and is still increasing! The team has finished working on a database on neurodivergent scholars; a blog about open scholarship and its intersection with neurodiversity, which has been expanded to a position statement manuscript; a manuscript accepted in the British Psychological Society Cognitive Psychology Bulletin and a manuscript accepted in Association in Psychological Science. Currently, we are developing a survey to assess masking and neurodivergence in academia and the convergence between open scholarship values and neurodivergent values. We have a rotating leadership team which changes every six months. To promote diverse and inclusive leadership, anyone can put themselves forward for this role, regardless of their experience. The current team leaders are Magdalena Grose-Hodge and Bethan Iley. Thank you to our previous team leaders: Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe, Flávio Azevedo, and Mahmoud Elsherif.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.tpa-tw.org/2021agenda?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;ldquo;International efforts to improve Psychological Science&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which was organized by
&lt;a href="mailto:csc2009@mail.tcu.edu.tw">Sau-Chin Chen&lt;/a> at Tzu-Chi University. We all &amp;ndash;ReproducibiliTea, COS&amp;rsquo;s OSKB, Montilla et al., Alzahawi &amp;amp; Monin, and FORRT&amp;ndash; presented on open scholarship topics. Here&amp;rsquo;s the symposium abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Beyond the local psychological issues, the challenges for psychological science are changing the norms and values of psychological researches. In comparison with the sophistication and innovation, many Western psychological researchers appraise the transparency and rigor. The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) have provided the platforms for the psychologists who are improving the research methods and practices. Since 2016, many proposals have turned to the global research projects or distributed networks for shared purposes. In this symposium five project leaders and representatives share the current situation and achievements. At Q&amp;amp;A section we will answer the questions and discuss the plans to manage these projects in Taiwan. This symposium introduce five projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Open Scholarship Knowledge Base - “a community of volunteer advocates working with researchers, educators, and anyone interested in open scholarship to build a knowledge base so that researchers and users can discover and apply open practices. “&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ReproducibiliTea - “a grassroots journal club initiative that helps researchers create local Open Science journal clubs at their universities to discuss diverse issues, papers and ideas about improving science, reproducibility and the Open Science movement.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training – “a networking brings together educators and scholars working to improve teaching and mentoring practices in higher education.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Non-WIERD guidelines – “a project to aid academic members evaluate and increase diversity and inclusion in psychological research studies.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crowd science – “a project aims to promote the diversity, rigor, and reliability of scientific research.”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
