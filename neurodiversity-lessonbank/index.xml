&lt;p> Focus on diversity in psychology can be traced back to the 1930s and Vygotsky, the pioneer of Sociocultural Approach&lt;/>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Activity 1 Respect for Diversity - Introduction &lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;span lang="PL">Read the introduction to diversity below and see if you can answer the questions below it.
&lt;div style="margin: 30px; padding: 0; border-top: 2px solid black; border-bottom: 2px solid black;">
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;span lang="PL">Respect for diversity &lt;/strong> has been established as a core value for Community Psychology,
as indicated in Chapter 1 (Jason et al., 2019). Appreciating diversity in communities includes understanding dimensions of
diversity and how to work within diverse community contexts, but also includes a consideration of how to work within systems
of inequality. Community psychologists must be mindful of diverse perspectives and experiences when conducting research and
designing interventions, as well as working to combat oppression and promote justice and equality. By working within a
framework of cultural humility, this chapter attempts to provide a basic understanding of the dimensions of diversity
that are most common in Community Psychology research and practice. Further, we explore how these dimensions contribute
to complex identities and considerations for community practice.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Activity4 The Academic Wheel of Privilege&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reflect on how you see or identify yourself in relation to
these dimensions. Which groups do you identify with? Have you heard the phrase "check your privilege"? Have you thought of
intersectionality and privilege in relation to yourself? FORRT has developed a
tool which allows everyone in academia to reflect on their privilege. Look at the video below, in which Bethan Iley, one of the members of FORRT explains the concept.&lt;/p>&lt;br>&lt;p>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>How to use the wheel:&lt;/b> Look at the dimensions of
privilege on the outside of the circle and choose the option from the inner
circle that describes your situation best. For every answer in the smallest
circle (the closest to the middle of the wheel), give yourself 1 point, then 2
points for the option in a slightly bigger circle and finally 3 points of the
option closest to the outside of the circle. Share your result with a friend or
keep it to yourself. Do you think this tool is useful? Is it important to check
our privilege? How can this make you more mindful of other’s experiences?&lt;/p>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">&lt;br>&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="activity">
&lt;p>&lt;em>You have discussed diversity in your previous class. Can you remember what the terms CULTURAL COMPETENCE and CULTURAL HUMILITY mean? Read the text below and explain the idea of PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH. How is it connected to cultural competence and humility?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adopting &lt;strong>cultural humility&lt;/strong> is necessary for considering diversity in research. In research, it is important to consider how questions are asked or which samples are included in a study. In addition, the importance of topics of research to diverse communities must be considered, which may require developing research topics and questions with the populations that are being impacted. Participatory action research is a valuable tool for developing topics in an inclusive way and is a method frequently used by community psychologists to find solutions in the social environment (Kidd &amp; Kral, 2005).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Research must also consider the power dynamics between the researcher and the community as well as the dynamics within the community. The use of culturally-anchored methodologies is important for exploring research questions in the appropriate context. &lt;strong>Marginalized groups are often compared to a majority group, but these comparisons may not always acknowledge the implications of power dynamics present in such comparisons.&lt;/strong> When developing the methodology, it is important for the researcher to acknowledge one's own cultural assumptions, experiences, and positions of power. Recognition of these aspects of self will lead to a more careful framing of the research question within context. Finally, it is important to consider where to disseminate research findings to reach wide audiences.&lt;/p>

&lt;div style="margin: 30px; padding: 0; border: 2px solid black; border: 2px solid black;">
&lt;p>If you have a moment, research the history of a condition that was referred to by doctors and scientists as &lt;b>"female hysteria"&lt;/b>.
Raulin, a French physician who studied "the condition" claimed that while it is not impossible for a man to contract hysteria, it is mainly women who suffer from it because of their "lazy and irritable nature".&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What are the dangers of conducting research into communities, cultures, or groups of people that we do not identify with?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can you think of claims that have been made about different groups of people based on conclusions
from studies that did not involve members of the researched communities in the design of the studies?
Can you think of reasons why science might pathologe minorities? Think about group psychology -
ingroup/outgroup effect (Billig &amp; Tajfel, 1973), and social identity theory (Tajfel 1979) or categorising
the world into "them" and "us". &lt;/P
&lt;div style="margin: 30px; padding: 0; border: 2px solid black; border: 2px solid black;">
&lt;p>&lt;b>Participatory research (PR)&lt;/b> encompasses research designs, methods, and frameworks
that use systematic inquiry in direct collaboration with those affected by an issue being studied
for the purpose of action or change (Vaughn and Jacquez, 2020).&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>How can focusing on participatory research contribute to social justice within the Open Scholarship framework? &lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Activity2 Deficit approaches and pathologising minorities&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>In the 70s, Bakan and colleagues have published a number of highly influential articles
that pathologised left handedness. Their claims, which were later revoked (e.g.,
Bishop, 1990), included that left handedness results from birth trauma and a
minor brain damage. Below are some of their papers that discussed the ideas.
Discuss how implicit bias may influence methods that are applied by scientists and how this could skew results. &lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style="list-style-type:square">

it have on the population? And the progress of research in the area? &lt;/i>&lt;/p>

&lt;b>Activity 4 Neurodiversity paradigm: spotting biased language&lt;/b>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Now choose one of the two articles below and skim the abstract and intro. Discuss or
reflect on the questions below.&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style="list-style-type:square;">
&lt;b>&lt;i>&amp;nbsp; Article 1:&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;i>
&lt;li>Zwaigenbaum, L., &amp;amp; Penner, M. (2018). Autism spectrum disorder: advances
in diagnosis and evaluation.&amp;nbsp;BMJ: British Medical Journal,&amp;nbsp;361. &lt;/i>&lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26959693">&lt;i>https://www.jstor.org/stable/26959693&lt;/i>&lt;/a>&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/li>
&lt;p>&lt;i>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;b>&lt;i>&amp;nbsp; Article 2:&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;i>
&lt;li>Faras, H., Al Ateeqi, N., &amp;amp; Tidmarsh, L. (2010). Autism
spectrum disorders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Annals of Saudi medicine&lt;/i>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>30&lt;/i>(4),
295–300. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/0256-4947.65261">https://doi.org/10.4103/0256-4947.65261&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;i>How is neurodivergence viewed by the authors? How do the authors see individuals with neurotypes other than neurotypical? &lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Are neurotypical and neurodivergent populations
perceived equally by the authors or is one of the groups given as a model and
the other compared to it by looking at their deficits?&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Can you see any
examples of pathologising language? Underline fragments that suggest that
neurodivergent brains are deficient rather than different. &lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Activity 5 Ableist Language in scientific publications&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;i>Look at some examples of language taken from these and other articles published in
the last 20 years in influential journals and discuss the language use. Can you
identify the implicit bias? What does it suggest about the perception of
different neurotypes held by the authors? &lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructions: drag and drop the fields to match the language found in papers (orange pin) and the corresponding comment (blue pin). Once you find a pair, put the fields side by side. Once you complete the task, check by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner. For full screen view, click on the square in the top right corner. &lt;/p>

&lt;ul style="list-style-type:square">
&lt;li>What is the assumed norm that autistic individuals are often measured against? Is this explicitly stated?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Norms are developed based on observations gathered through research. Where is most research conducted? Which populations is it mainly conducted on? Which groups may be underrepresented or purposefully excluded from studies? How does this affect norms?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Normative science is pervasive in many fields. Pay attention to assumed standards and implicit bias in articles you read. How can we become more aware of our own biases? &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is it possible for early researchers avoid unquestioned acceptance of paradigms, terminology and methods?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p> Post your reflection below. &lt;/p>

&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read and discuss the following citations:&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>1. Psychology of oppression reveals t&lt;span>hat
&lt;span style="">oppression is not always perceptible and repellant&lt;/span>. It&lt;/span> can be disguised and
beguiling. People do not always know they are oppressed. Sometimes they have to
be educated about their oppression. The reason is that oppression stunts
people’s critical, rational, analytical, and probing capabilities. Normative
oppression also becomes taken for granted and mundane and therefore
imperceptible&lt;/em> (Ratner, 2014).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>2. People cannot reject the system of
domination without rejecting [part of] themselves, their own repressive
instinctual needs and values &lt;/em> (Marcuse,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5583-7_571#ref-CR161164" title="Marcuse, H. (1969). An essay on liberation. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.">1969&lt;/a>, p. 17).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>Advocating the mere tolerance of difference between women is the grossest reformism.
It is a total denial of the creative function of difference in our lives. Difference must be
not merely tolerated, but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our
creativity can spark like a dialectic. Only then does the necessity for interdependency
Lorde 2
become unthreatening. Only within that interdependency of difference strengths,
acknowledged and equal, can the power to seek new ways of being in the world generate,
as well as the courage and sustenance to act where there are no charters &lt;/em>(Lorde, 1984)&lt;em>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span>&lt;em>Now read the short essay written by Audre Lorde in 1984. What does she mean when she says that the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house?&lt;/em>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="https://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lorde_The_Masters_Tools.pdf">Lorde, Audre. “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House.” 1984.

&lt;p>How do you understand these words? What do you think about them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity 3&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>Now read Nick Walker's essay titled "Throw away the master's tools: Liberating ourselves from the pathology paradigm." What is he advocating for? What alternative to the pathology paradigm does he propose?&amp;nbsp; Can you explain the difference and summarise his arguments?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity 2 - Case studies&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Discuss problems relating to design that you can identify in the following case studies.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. A study examining the efficacy of a new heart medication conducted in a sample of primarily young, healthy individuals, with little representation from older adults and those with pre-existing heart conditions.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A study investigating the prevalence of depression in college students, conducted at a single university with a predominantly white student population, and with little representation from students of other races and ethnicities.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A study examining the effectiveness of a new cancer treatment conducted in a single hospital in a major metropolitan area, with little representation from patients living in rural or suburban areas.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A study examining the effects of a new teaching method on student achievement conducted in a single school with a homogeneous student population, and with little consideration given to cultural or linguistic differences.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A study investigating the effectiveness of a new therapy for anxiety conducted using only self-reported measures of anxiety, with no consideration given to other potential outcomes or measures.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>6.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; A study examining the prevalence of a particular health condition conducted in a single survey administered to participants over the course of a single day, with no follow-up or longitudinal data collected.&lt;/p>&lt;p>____________________&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A study examining the efficacy of a new mental health intervention that showed significant improvements in a single clinical trial, but was not replicated in subsequent trials or in real-world clinical settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Activity 3 - Implications&lt;/strong>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>Reflecting on the case studies and research that you are familiar with - what could be some implications of these design flaws?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;br>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;span>&lt;em>Now look at some specific examples. Can you add anything else?&lt;/em>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;span>Here are some specific examples of problems caused by the generalizability crisis. Match them to the titles:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;span>&lt;br>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span>&lt;strong>Some groups might be disadvantaged regarding depression treatment&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span>&lt;strong>Lack of representation of diverse populations in clinical trials&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span>&lt;strong>Some groups overlooked in genetic research&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span>&lt;strong>Inaccurate treatment recommendations for women&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span>&lt;strong>Black skin conditions not as easy to treat&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;br>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;ol>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some studies on dermatological conditions have found that certain treatments may not be as effective for black patients due to differences in skin biology. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found that black patients with acne may have more resistant and inflammatory acne than white patients, which may require different treatment approaches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Many clinical trials have historically excluded certain populations, such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and older adults. This can limit our understanding of how certain treatments or interventions work in these populations. For example, a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that cancer clinical trials often underrepresent racial and ethnic minorities, which can limit our understanding of the effectiveness of cancer treatments in these populations.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Many studies on cardiovascular disease have historically focused on men, which can lead to inaccurate treatment recommendations for women. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that women are less likely than men to receive evidence-based treatments for heart attacks, which can result in worse outcomes.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some genetic research has been criticized for being too focused on populations of European ancestry, which can limit our understanding of genetic diversity and disease risk in other populations. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics found that many genetic studies have underrepresented or excluded African populations, which can limit our understanding of genetic diversity and disease risk in these populations.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some mental health studies have focused on populations from Western cultures, which can limit our understanding of mental health in other cultures. For example, a study published in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology found that many measures of depression and anxiety may not be appropriate for use in non-Western cultures, which can limit our understanding of mental health in these populations.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br>&lt;p>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;strong>Activity 4 - Strategies to address the problem&lt;/strong>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;strong>&lt;br>&lt;/strong>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span>&lt;em style="">Look back at the case studies and discuss / reflect on how these flaws could be addressed. Brainstorm how the problem can be mitigated in your field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;br>&lt;p>&lt;/p>
