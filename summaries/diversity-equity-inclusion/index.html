Low economic development, poor health conditions and low levels of educational attainment are often comorbidities shared in these communities.</li><li>Discrimination hinders social mobility of ethnic and racial minorities. In the US, 39% of African American children and adolescents, and 33% of Latino children and adolescents are living in poverty, which is more than double than the 14% poverty rate for non-Latino, White and Asian children and adolescents.</li><li>Minority racial groups are more likely to experience multidimensional poverty than their White counterparts. American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian families are more likely than Caucasian and Asian families to live in poverty.</li><li>“African Americans (53%) and Latinos (43%) are more likely to receive high-cost mortgages than Caucasians (18%; Logan, 2008).” (p.9).</li><li>African American unemployment rates are double of Caucasian Americans. African American men working full time earn only 72% of Caucasian men's average earnings, and 85% of earnings of Caucasian women.</li><li>African Americans and Latinos are more likely to attend high-poverty schools than Asian Americans and Caucasians. From 2000 to 2013, dropout rates between racial groups narrowed significantly.  High school dropouts were highest for Latinos, followed by African Americans and Whites.</li><li>High achieving African American students may be exposed to less rigorous curriculums, attend schools with fewer resources, and have teachers who expect less of them academically than similarly situated Caucasian students.</li><li>12% of African American college graduates were unemployed, which is more than double the rate of unemployment among all college graduates in the same age range.</li><li>Racial and ethnic minorities have worse health than that of White Americans.</li><li>Health disparities stem from economic determinants, education, geography, neighbourhood, environment, lower-quality care, inadequate access to care, inability to navigate the system, provider ignorance or bias, and stress.</li><li>“At each level of income or education, African American have worse outcomes than Whites. This could be due to adverse health effects of more concentrated disadvantage or a range of experiences related to racial bias (Braveman, Cubbin, Egerter, Williams, & Pamuk, 2010).” (p.10).</li><li>In pre-retirement years, Hispanics and American Indians are much less likely than Whites, African Americans, and Asians to have any health insurance. Negative net worth, zero net worth, and not owning a home in young adulthood are linked to depressive symptoms independent of other socio-economic indicators.</li><li>Hispanics and African Americans report a lower risk of psychiatric disorder relative to White counterparts, but those who become ill tend to have more persistent disorders.</li><li>African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, and Native Hawaiians have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorders than Whites, which is not explained by Socio-economic status and a history of psychiatric  disorders. However discrimination is factor that contributes to increasing mental health disorders among the Asian and African American communities (i.e., compared to the White community, African American communities are more frequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, a low prevalence but serious condition).</li></ul><h3>Abstract</h3>Learn how socioeconomic status affects the lives of many racial and ethnic minorities.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>APA (2017, July).

One of the most effective (but least discussed) measures is to change how we appoint and promote our faculty members.</li><li>Promotion criteria has changed over time. Committees now consider how well a candidate participates in team science, but we still depend on imperfect metrics for judging research publications and our ability to assess reliability and accuracy is underdeveloped.</li><li>Reproducibility and robustness are under-emphasised when job applicants are evaluated and when faculty members are promoted.</li><li>Currently, reviewers of committees are asked to assess how a field would be different without a candidate’s contributions, and to survey a candidate’s accomplishment, scholarship, and recognition.</li><li>The promotion process should also encourage evaluators to say whether they feel candidates’ work is problematic or over-stated and whether it has been reproduced and broadly accepted. If not, they should say whether they believe widespread reproducibility is likely or whether work will advance the field.</li><li>Applicants should also be asked to critically evaluate their research, including unanswered questions, controversies and uncertainties. This signals the importance of assessment and creates a mechanism to judge a candidate’s capacity for critical self-reflection.</li><li>Evaluators should be asked to consider how technical and statistical issues were handled by candidates. Research and discovery is not simple and unidirectional, and evaluators should be sceptical of candidates who oversimplify.</li><li>Institutions need to incentivise data sharing and transparency. Efforts are more urgent as increasingly interdisciplinary projects extend beyond individual investigators’ expertise.</li><li>Success will need creativity, pragmatism and diplomacy, because investigators bristle at any perceived imposition on their academic freedom.</li></ul><h3>Quote</h3><blockquote class="blockquote font-italic" style=font-size:1rem>“Over time, efforts to increase the ratio of self-reflection to self-promotion may be the best way to improve science.

We coded more than 3,400 papers referenced on these syllabi for gender of authors as well as other characteristics. Less than 30% of the papers referenced on these syllabi were written by female first authors, with no evidence of a trend toward greater inclusion of papers published by female first authors since the 1980s. The difference in inclusion rates of female first-authored papers could not be explained by a preference for including classic over contemporary papers in syllabi (there was evidence of a recency bias instead) or the relative availability of female first-authored papers in the published literature.

Prior to initiating programming, all potential institutional representatives set initial goals to address campus needs for mentor-up skill development for post-docs and mentor facilitator training for staff and faculty, establish sustainable communities of practice for mentor training and develop mechanisms for central coordination, outreach to campus constituents, templates for recruitment of participants and strategies to sustain collaboration and develop mechanisms for central coordination, outreach to campus constituents, templates for recruitment of participants, and strategies to sustain collaboration.” (p.4)</li><li>Method:  “The seven Core Principles [of “Mentoring-UP”] are: 1. Two-way communication, 2. Aligning expectations, 3. Assessing understanding, 4. Fostering independence, 5. Ethics, 6. Addressing equity and inclusion, 7. Promoting professional development. This curriculum provided postdocs opportunities for: i.) self-evaluation and reflection to become aware of their personal biases, attitudes, and behaviors; ii.) exploring strengths, weaknesses, and challenges in their interpersonal and professional relationships; iii.) understanding and learning how to use the mentor principles; and iv.) focusing on cognitive processes that may lead to behavioral changes and strategies to facilitate those changes in a process-based approach over 1.5–2 day workshops.” (p.5)</li><li>Method: “The 1.5–2 day workshops included case studies and activities that: i.) engage mentors in peer discussion of a mentor framework; ii.) explore strategies to improve mentoring relationships; iii.) address mentoring problems; iv.) reflect on mentoring philosophies; v.) and create mentoring action plans to model the interactive, collaborative, and problem-solving ways to develop and implement this set of trainings in the future. The training goals provided tools and mechanisms to implement mentor training venues at the participating institutions, thereby establishing sustainable Mentor-training programs for undergrads, graduate students, postdocs and faculty” (p.5).</li><li>“A specific NRMN-CAN survey was developed for all four postdoc cohorts to ascertain whether mentor training: i.) influenced career progression; ii.) impacted the postdocs’ relationship with their PIs; and iii.) components of the mentor training that were implemented by the postdoc mentees... A dedicated NRMN-CAN survey for faculty and senior administrators was also developed to ascertain whether participation in Mentor Facilitator training led to: i.) implementation of training workshops on their campuses; ii.) the level and number of participants; iii.) and whether facilitated sessions were carried out in partnership with others.” (p.5)</li><li>Results: Post-doctoral students reported improvements in their mentoring proficiency and improved relationships with the Principal Investigators. 29% of post-doc respondents transitioned to faculty positions, and 85% of these respondents were under-represented and 75% were female. 59 out of 120 faculty and administrators provided mentor training to over 3000 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and faculty on their campus for the duration of this  project.</li><li>The findings showed that the majority of post-doctoral students indicate that mentor training positively influenced their relationship with their Mentors in several domains (e.g. confidence building). In addition, this curriculum has guided most post-doctoral students to better understand their mentoring needs, develop strategies to manage their mentoring relationships and empower them to make critical career decisions to pursue an academic career.  In addition, early-career scientists stated they had more confidence to pursue an academic career with increased self-efficiency and advocacy.</li><li>Impressively, 29% of the responding postdocs, predominantly females (75%) and underrepresented postdocs (85%) have successfully migrated to faculty. Some postdocs also indicated that their mentor training and experiences were valuable skills when applying for academic positions and definitely aided in adapting to responsibilities as a faculty mentor.</li></ul><h3>Abstract</h3>Changing institutional culture to be more diverse and inclusive within the biomedical academic community is difficult for many reasons. Herein we present evidence that a collaborative model involving multiple institutions of higher education can initiate and execute individual institutional change directed at enhancing diversity and inclusion at the postdoctoral researcher (postdoc) and junior faculty level by implementing evidence-based mentoring practices. A higher education consortium, the Big Ten Academic Alliance, invited individual member institutions to send participants to one of two types of annual mentor training: 1) “Mentoring-Up” training for postdocs, a majority of whom were from underrepresented groups; 2) Mentor Facilitator training—a train-the-trainer model—for faculty and senior leadership. From 2016 to 2019, 102 postdocs and 160 senior faculty and administrative leaders participated. Postdocs reported improvements in their mentoring proficiency (87%) and improved relationships with their PIs (71%). 29% of postdoc respondents transitioned to faculty positions, and 85% of these were underrepresented and 75% were female. 59 out of the 120 faculty and administrators (49%) trained in the first three years provided mentor training on their campuses to over 3000 undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs and faculty within the project period. We conclude that early stage biomedical professionals as well as individual institutions of higher education benefited significantly from this collaborative mentee/mentor training model<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Risner, L.

To solve this issue, governments and funding bodies need to accept that students and universities should be eligible for the same kinds of temporary emergency funding as other industries are asking for.</li><li>Governments have denied requests to negotiate with universities or delayed decisions.

It is also true that fame and quality clearly sometimes diverge: many people who do excellent work are barely known, and some people are famous even though their work is mediocre. Reliance on fame and name recognition when identifying psychologists as candidates for honors and awards helps to perpetuate a range of stereotypes and prevents us from broadening participation in our field, particularly from women and underrepresented groups. The pursuit of fame may also be contributing to the current crisis in psychology concerning research integrity, because it incentivizes quantity and speed in publishing. The right attitude towards fame is to use it wisely if it happens to come, but to focus our efforts on conducting excellent research and nurturing talent in others.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Ferreira, F.

In today’s academic world, a meritorious scholar is one who publishes high quality work that is frequently cited, who receives plentiful funding and scientific awards, and who is well regarded among his or her peers. In other words, merit is defined by how successful the scholar has been in terms of promoting his or her own career. In this commentary, I argue that there has been an overemphasis on measuring individual career outcomes and that we should be more concerned with the effect that scholars have on the scientific system in which they are embedded. Put simply, the question we should be asking is whether and to what extent a scholar has advanced the scientific discipline and moved the field forward collectively.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Pickett, C.

When, in fact, it does not.” (p.7)</blockquote><h3>Abstract</h3>To be famous is to be widely known, and honored for one’s achievements. The process by which researchers achieve fame or eminence is skewed by heuristics that influence visibility; implications of these heuristics are magnified by a snowball effect, in which current fame leads to bias in ostensibly objective metrics of merit, including the distribution of resources that support future excellence. This effect may disproportionately hurt women and minorities, who struggle with both external and internalized implicit biases regarding competence and worth. While some solutions to this problem are available, they will not address the deeper problems of defining what it means for research to “make a difference” in our field and in society, and consistently holding our work to that criterion.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Shiota, M.

It produced these accomplishments not through magic or appeals to authority, but through open, detailed, and reproducible methods. To call something “science” means there are clear ways to independently and empirically evaluate research claims. There is no need to simply trust an information source. Scientific values thus prioritize transparency and universalism, emphasizing that it matters less who has made a discovery than how it was done. Yet, scientific reward systems are based on identifying individual eminence. The current paper contrasts this focus on individual eminence with reforms to scientific rewards systems that help these systems better align with scientific values.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Corker, K.

The replicability crisis has shown that a system without transparency doesn’t work. The lack of transparency in science is a direct consequence of the corrupting influence of eminence-seeking. If journals and societies are primarily motivated by boosting their impact, their most effective strategy will be to publish the sexiest findings by the most famous authors. Humans will always care about eminence. Scientific institutions and gatekeepers should be a bulwark against the corrupting influence of the drive for eminence, and help researchers maintain integrity and uphold scientific values in the face of internal and external pressures to compromise. One implication for evaluating scientific merit is that gatekeepers should attempt to reward all scientists whose work reaches a more objective threshold of scientific rigor or soundness, rather than attempting to select the cream of the crop (i.e., identify the most “eminent”).<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Vazire, S.

However, most currently eminent psychologists started their careers when far fewer women pursued training in psychological science. Now that women earn the majority of psychology Ph.D.’s, will they predominate in the next generation’s cadre of eminent psychologists? Comparing currently active female and male psychology professors on publication metrics such as the h index provides clues for answering this question. Men outperform women on the h index and its two components: scientific productivity and citations of contributions. To interpret these gender gaps, we first evaluate whether publication metrics are affected by gender bias in obtaining grant support, publishing papers, or gaining citations of published papers. We also consider whether women’s chances of attaining eminence are compromised by two intertwined sets of influences: (a) gender bias stemming from social norms pertaining to gender and to science and (b) the choices that individual psychologists make in pursuing their careers.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Eagly, A.

We hypothesize that people perceive Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers as being especially incompatible with an orientation to care about other people (i.e. communion). Because women in particular tend to endorse communal goals, they may be more likely than men to opt out of STEM careers in favor of careers that seem to afford communion.</li><li>These trends suggest that to explain women’s absence in STEM fields, research should focus on factors that differentiate careers in STEM from other careers. We hypothesize that a critical but relatively unexplored factor may be that many non-STEM careers are perceived as fulfilling communal goals.</li><li>We thus examined (a) whether communal-goal affordances are perceived to differ between STEM and other careers, and (b) whether communal-goal endorsement inhibits STEM interest, given consensual beliefs about the goals these careers afford.</li><li>Method: 333 introductory psychology students provided goal-affordance ratings and information about their mathematics and science experience. Our goal was to determine predictors of differential interest in STEM, male-stereotypic/non-STEM (MST), and female-stereotypic (FST) careers. To create scales reflecting these different stereotypic categories, we used archival and primary data.</li><li>Method: For each core career, participants rated how much they considered the career to fulfill agentic goals (power, achievement, and seeking new experiences or excitement) and communal goals (intimacy, affiliation, and altruism).</li><li>Method: Because career interest was our critical dependent measure, participants rated their interest in the core careers, as well as additional careers.</li><li>Method: Participants rated several goals according to “how important each of the following kinds of goals is to you personally,” on scales ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 7 (extremely important).</li><li>Method: Self-efficacy and experience. Measures of self-efficacy included the scientific, mechanical, and computational subscales of the Kuder Task Self-Efficacy Scale as well as participants’ estimated grades in STEM classes.</li><li>Results: The authors found that STEM careers, relative to other careers, were perceived to impede communal goals. Moreover, communal-goal endorsement negatively predicted interest in STEM careers, even when controlling for past experience and self-efficacy in science and mathematics.</li><li>STEM careers are perceived as inhibiting communal goals: When individuals highly endorse communal goals, they are less interested in STEM. If women perceive STEM as antithetical to highly valued goals, it is not surprising that even women talented in these areas might choose alternative career paths.</li><li>Certainly, traditionally studied predictors of STEM interest, such as agentic motivations or self-efficacy, continue to be critical factors. Our argument is not that the study of communal motivations should replace agentic motivations or self-efficacy, but that this traditional approach overlooks critically important information.</li></ul><h3>Quote</h3><blockquote class="blockquote font-italic" style=font-size:1rem>“It is ironic that STEM fields hold the key to helping many people, but are commonly regarded as antithetical (or, at best, irrelevant) to such communal goals. However, the first step toward change is increasing knowledge about this belief and its consequences. Interventions could not only provide opportunities for girls and young women to succeed in mathematics and science but also demonstrate how STEM fields involve helping and collaborating with other people. For example, our current research investigates how portraying science or engineering careers as more other-oriented fosters positivity.” (p.1056).</blockquote><h3>Abstract</h3>Although women have nearly attained equality with men in several formerly male-dominated fields, they remain underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We argue that one important reason for this discrepancy is that STEM careers are perceived as less likely than careers in other fields to fulfill communal goals (e.g., working with or helping other people). Such perceptions might disproportionately affect women’s career decisions, because women tend to endorse communal goals more than men. As predicted, we found that STEM careers, relative to other careers, were perceived to impede communal goals. Moreover, communal-goal endorsement negatively predicted interest in STEM careers, even when controlling for past experience and self-efficacy in science and mathematics. Understanding how communal goals influence people’s interest in STEM fields thus provides a new perspective on the issue of women’s representation in STEM careers.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Diekman, A.

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent.

It also contains a citation network in which every node represents a paper and every directed edge represents a citation. While the number of citations of any given paper is not provided explicitly, it can be calculated from the citation network in any given year. Additionally, every paper is positioned in a field-of-study hierarchy, the highest level of which comprises 19 scientific disciplines.</li><li>The authors derive two key measures: the discipline of scientists and their impact and additional measures such as the scientists’ gender. Whenever a junior scientist (with academic age = 7) publishes a paper with a senior scientist (academic age > 7), the former is defined as a protégé, and the latter is delineated as a mentor. The author analyze every mentor–protégé dyad that satisfies all of the following conditions: (i) the protégé has at least one publication during their senior years without a mentor; (ii) the affiliation of the protégé is in the US throughout their mentorship years; (iii) the main discipline of the mentor is the same as that of the protégé; (iv) the mentor and the protégé share an affiliation on at least one publication; (v) during the mentorship period, the mentor and the protégé worked together on a paper whose number of authors is 20 or less; and (vi) the protégé does not have a gap of 5-years or more in their publication history.</li><li>Results: The author finds that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors.

Interestingly, the big-shot experience seems to matter more than the hub experience, implying that the scientific impact of mentors matters more than the number of their collaborators. The association between the big-shot experience and the post-mentorship outcome persists regardless of the discipline, the affiliation rank, the number of mentors, the average age of the mentors, the protégé’s gender, and the protégé’s first year of publication.</li><li>The present study suggests that female protégés who remain in academia reap more benefits when mentored by males rather than equally-impactful females. The specific drivers underlying this empirical fact could be multifold, such as female mentors serving on more committees, thereby reducing the time they are able to invest in their protégés or women taking onless recognized topics that their protégés emulate.</li><li>Additionally,  findings also suggest that mentors benefit more when working with male protégés rather than working with comparable female protégés, especially if the mentor is female. These conclusions are all deduced from careful comparisons between protégés who published their first mentored paper in the same discipline, in the same cohort, and at the very same institution.</li><li>One potential explanation could be that, historically, male scientists had enjoyed more privileges and access to resources than their female counterparts, and thus were able to provide more support to their protégés. Alternatively, these findings may be attributed to sorting mechanisms within programs based on the quality of protégés and the gender of mentors.</li><li>The gender-related findings suggest that current diversity policies promoting female–female mentorships, as well-intended as they may be, could hinder the careers of women who remain in academia in unexpected ways.

Bias may be reinforced by gender subordinating language or differential use of formality in forms of address. Professional titles may influence the perceived expertise and authority of the referenced individual. The objective of this study is to examine how professional titles were used in the same and mixed-gender speaker introductions at Internal Medicine Grand Rounds (IMGR).Methods: A retrospective observational study of video-archived speaker introductions at consecutive IMGR was conducted at two different locations (Arizona, Minnesota) of an academic medical center. Introducers and speakers at IMGR were physician and scientist peers holding MD, PhD, or MD/PhD degrees. The primary outcome was whether or not a speaker’s professional title was used during the first form of address during speaker introductions at IMGR. As secondary outcomes, we evaluated whether or not the speakers professional title was used in any form of address during the introduction.Results: Three hundred twenty-one forms of address were analyzed. Female introducers were more likely to use professional titles when introducing any speaker during the first form of address compared with male introducers (96.2% [102/106] vs. 65.6% [141/215]; p &lt; 0.001). Female dyads utilized formal titles during the first form of address 97.8% (45/46) compared with male dyads who utilized a formal title 72.4% (110/152) of the time ( p = 0.007). In mixed-gender dyads, where the introducer was female and speaker male, formal titles were used 95.0% (57/60) of the time. Male introducers of female speakers utilized professional titles 49.2% (31/63) of the time ( p &lt; 0.001).Conclusion: In this study, women introduced by men at IMGR were less likely to be addressed by professional title than were men introduced by men. Differential formality in speaker introductions may amplify isolation, marginalization, and professional discomfiture expressed by women faculty in academic medicine.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Files, J.

Across these regions, young scientists are working to build practices for open science from the ground up. The aim is that scientific communities will incorporate these principles as they grow. But these communities’ needs differ from those that are part of mature research systems. So, rather than shifting and shaping established systems, scientists are endeavouring to design new ones.</li><li>Financial and career incentives to publish (or disadvantages from not publishing) are common government policies in countries such as Indonesia, China and Brazil where research culture is still being shaped. They aim to increase publication quantity to ‘catch up’ with other countries, but inadvertently encourage poor research practices.</li><li>Lower-income countries cannot waste resources on funding untrustworthy research. Policies should therefore be designed to improve transparency, relevance and scientific rigour, rather than just to increase output — especially if governments want to use research to inform decision-making. Governments must also provide the training, resources and motivation needed for people to take these changes to heart.</li><li>Crucially, the team will include researchers from many different types of university, not just the largest ones. Going forward, the institute will monitor whether the repository improves research quality. Other countries will face different issues. But a commonality will be that all stakeholders — not just the rich or prestigious ones — should be involved in finding a solution.</li><li>Most universities in Asia, Africa and Latin America were set up for education. Many are ill-equipped to perform research and lack the proper infrastructure.</li><li>Sustainable changes require education. Universities should train researchers not just in field-specific theories, but also in how to improve scientific practice. This training should cover the pitfalls of modern academia (e.g. prestige and academic metrics) have contributed to publication bias. It must address the consequences of succumbing to these pressures for the quality, replicability and trustworthiness of research. And it should honestly highlight disagreements about whether and when these practices actually work — debates about when pre-registration of research is and is not useful, for instance. And researchers must learn about these topics as they begin their research careers, even as undergraduates, rather having to modify existing practices later.</li><li>Training in good scientific practices will set scientists up to think more critically and to adopt practices that increase the credibility of their work.</li><li>Training will also enable researchers to add their diverse voices to continuing debates about open science, including active consideration of how science can benefit society, locally and globally. This shift towards open research might require a reworking of the overall training package, reducing the number of field-specific courses to avoid an overwhelming workload.</li><li>Journals should take an active role in reducing under-representation, without compromising rigour. Ask authors to explicitly describe the populations they study upfront, and not to generalize their findings beyond this sample without good reason. Open reviews could reduce potential bias against samples from outside Western countries. Established journals should make efforts to communicate their standards to scientists in developing research cultures, and could also host special issues focused on understanding under-represented populations.</li><li>A lack of funding and travel restrictions in many parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America reduce these opportunities for international collaboration, networking and travel, leading to researchers becoming more isolated. Such problems need to be acknowledged explicitly and confronted.</li><li>Metrics and policies should be in place only if they are useful to science’s goal: knowledge accumulation for the greater societal good. Constant monitoring and introspection are therefore essential. Some of the best initiatives to improve science today might not be relevant in the future.</li></ul><h3>Quote</h3><blockquote class="blockquote font-italic" style=font-size:1rem>“If young research cultures can guard against harmful practices becoming ingrained, they have the opportunity to lay down a new type of strategy for open research.

First, gender bias in academia affects female scientists, resulting in their underrepresentation in academic institutions, particularly in higher ranks. The second type of gender bias in science relates to some findings applying only to male participants, which produces biased knowledge. Here, we identify a third potentially powerful source of gender bias in academia: the bias against research on gender bias. In a bibliometric investigation covering a broad range of social sciences, we analyzed published articles on gender bias and race bias and established that articles on gender bias are funded less often and published in journals with a lower Impact Factor than articles on comparable instances of social discrimination. This result suggests the possibility of an underappreciation of the phenomenon of gender bias and related research within the academic community. Addressing this meta-bias is crucial for the further examination of gender inequality, which severely affects many women across the world.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Cislak, A., Formanowicz, M., & Saguy, T.

However, relatively little is known about how structural factors influence the spread of ideas, and specifically how where an idea originates might influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205 Phd.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism, we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea originates on its long-term diffusion across the network. We find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. Our results establish faculty hiring as an underlying mechanism that drives the persistent epistemic advantage observed for elite institutions, and provide a theoretical lower bound for the impact of structural inequality in shaping the spread of ideas in science.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Morgan, A.

We seek to explain and understand the diverse ways that participating in an unofficial Feminist Reading Group in our department affected our experiences. We contend that informal peer support networks like reading groups do more than is conventionally assumed, and may provide important avenues for sustaining feminist research in times of austerity, as well as supporting and enabling women and emerging feminist scholars in academia. Participating in the group created a community of belonging and resistance, providing women with personal validation, information and material support, as well as intellectual and political resources to understand and resist our position within the often hostile spaces of the University. While these experiences are specific to our context, time and location, they signal that peer networks may offer critical political resources for responding to the ways that women’s bodies and concerns are marginalised in increasingly competitive and corporatised university environments.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Macoun, A., & Miller, D.

Moreover, as female role-models can positively influence young women’s propensities to enter male-dominated fields (Bonneau and Kanthak, 2018; Breda et al., 2020), administrators’ success or failure here could have downstream impacts on female representation in the academy for the next generation.” (p.15)</blockquote><h3>Abstract</h3>Does the pandemic exacerbate gender inequality in academia? The temporal lag in publication pipeline complicates the effort to determine the extent to which women’s productivity is disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis. We provide real-time evidence by analyzing 1.8 million tweets from approximately 3,000 political scientists, leveraging their use of social media for career advancement. Using automated text analysis and difference-in-differences estimation, we find that while faculty members of both genders were affected by the pandemic, the gap in work-related tweets between male and female academics roughly tripled following work-from-home. We further argue that these effects are likely driven by the increased familial obligations placed on women, as demonstrated by the increase in family-related tweets and the more pronounced effects among junior academics. Our causal evidence on work-family trade-off provides an opportunity for proactive efforts to address gender disparities that may otherwise take years to manifest.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Kim, E., & Patterson, S.

However, gender in the membership of editorial boards of scientific journals is a topic that only recently has started to attract the attention of researchers, and there is little literature on this subject as of today. The objective of this work is to present a study of the current state of editorial boards with regard to gender. The methodology is based on a literature review of gender issues in academia, and more specifically in the incipient field of gender in editorial boards. The main findings of this work, according to the reviewed bibliography, are that women are underrepresented in academic institutions, that this underrepresentation is increasingly marked in higher rank positions in academia and in editorial boards, and that this carries the risk of narrowing the nature and scope of the research in some fields of knowledge.<h3>APA Style Reference</h3><p>Ghasemi, N.
